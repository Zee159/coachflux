# COMPASS Framework Flow Simulation Results

## Executive Summary

âœ… **ALL TESTS PASSED** - COMPASS framework correctly enforces step completion and prevents premature advancement.

Users can successfully complete COMPASS sessions with three different interaction patterns:
1. **Comprehensive answers** - Full information provided
2. **Strategic skips** - Using 2 skips per step
3. **Minimal info** - Maximum flexibility with skips

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Comprehensive Answers âœ… PASS

**User Profile:** Provides detailed responses to all questions

**Results:**
- âœ… All 7 steps completed successfully
- âœ… All required fields captured (5/5 for most steps)
- âœ… Session marked as COMPLETE

**Step Breakdown:**

| Step | Status | Fields | Required |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| CLARITY | âœ… | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| OWNERSHIP | âœ… | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| MAPPING | âœ… | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| PRACTICE | âœ… | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| ANCHORING | âœ… | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| SUSTAINING | âœ… | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| REVIEW | âœ… | 2/2 | 2/2 |

**Example Responses:**
- CLARITY: Provided change description, why it matters, supporters, resistors, and clarity score
- OWNERSHIP: Shared personal feelings, benefits, risks, values alignment, and commitment level
- MAPPING: Defined 3 actions with obstacles and confidence score
- PRACTICE: Described actions taken, successes, challenges, and lessons learned

### Scenario 2: Strategic Skips âœ… PASS

**User Profile:** Uses skips strategically to move through steps faster

**Results:**
- âœ… All 7 steps completed successfully
- âœ… Flexible field requirements based on skip count
- âœ… Session marked as COMPLETE

**Skip Strategy:**

| Step | Skips | Fields Captured | Required | Status |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| CLARITY | 2 | 2/5 | 2/5 | âœ… |
| OWNERSHIP | 1 | 3/5 | 3/5 | âœ… |
| MAPPING | 0 | 3/3 | 3/3 | âœ… |
| PRACTICE | 2 | 2/5 | 2/5 | âœ… |
| ANCHORING | 1 | 3/5 | 3/5 | âœ… |
| SUSTAINING | 0 | 5/5 | 4/5 | âœ… |
| REVIEW | 0 | 2/2 | 2/2 | âœ… |

**How It Works:**
- Each step allows up to 2 skips
- Skip count reduces required fields:
  - 0 skips: 4-5 fields required (strict)
  - 1 skip: 3 fields required (lenient)
  - 2 skips: 1-2 fields required (very lenient)
- Users can still complete sessions with minimal information

---

### Scenario 4: No Premature Advancement âœ… PASS

**Purpose:** Verify the old bug is fixed

**Old Bug Behavior:**
- CLARITY step only required `change_description` + `clarity_score`
- Coach would advance immediately without asking about:
  - Why it matters
  - Who supports the change
  - Who resists the change

**New Behavior:**
- CLARITY step requires 4/5 fields (without skips)
- With only 2 fields provided, step remains INCOMPLETE
- Coach asks follow-up questions to gather missing information

**Test Result:**

```
Payload: {"change_description":"CRM migration","clarity_score":3}
Skip count: 0 (no skips)
Required fields: 4 out of 5
Captured fields: 2 out of 5
âœ… Should NOT advance: true
âœ… FIXED: Coach will ask for more information
```
