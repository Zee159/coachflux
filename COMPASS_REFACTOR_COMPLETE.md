## 📋 What Changed

### 1. Framework Structure
**OLD (6 stages):**
- Clarity → Ownership → Mapping → Anchoring → Sustaining → Practice

**NEW (4 stages + Introduction):**
- **Introduction** (2 min): CSS baseline measurements
- **Clarity** (4 min): Understand change + identify control
- **Ownership** (9 min): Transform fear → confidence (TRANSFORMATION STAGE)
- **Mapping** (5 min): Create ONE specific action
- **Practice** (2 min): Lock commitment + CSS finals

### 2. Measurement System
**OLD**: 1-5 scale scores per stage  
**NEW**: Composite Success Score (CSS) with 4 dimensions
- Confidence Transformation (1-10)
- Action Clarity (1-10)
- Mindset Shift (resistant/neutral/open/engaged)
- Session Value (1-10)

### 3. High-Confidence Branching
**NEW FEATURE**: Adaptive coaching based on initial confidence
- **High-confidence path** (≥8/10): 3 questions in Ownership
- **Standard path** (<8/10): 7 questions in Ownership

## 📊 New Data Schema

### Introduction Stage
```typescript
{
  initial_confidence: number,        // 1-10 (CSS baseline)
  initial_action_clarity: number,    // 1-10 (CSS baseline)
  initial_mindset_state: string      // resistant/neutral/open/engaged
}
```

### Clarity Stage
```typescript
{
  change_description: string,        // What's changing
  sphere_of_control: string,         // What they can control
  clarity_score?: number             // 1-10 (optional)
}
```

### Ownership Stage
```typescript
{
  // High-confidence path (≥8/10)
  confidence_source?: string,        // What gives them confidence
  
  // Standard path (<8/10)
  current_confidence?: number,       // 1-10 during session
  
  // Both paths
  personal_benefit: string,          // Personal gain
  past_success: {                    // Previous success story
    achievement: string,
    strategy: string
  }
}
```

### Mapping Stage
```typescript
{
  committed_action: string,          // ONE specific action
  action_day: string,                // When (day)
  action_time: string,               // When (time)
  obstacle?: string,                 // Potential barrier
  backup_plan?: string,              // Contingency
  support_person?: string            // Who can help
}
```

### Practice Stage
```typescript
{
  action_commitment_confidence: number,  // 1-10 (will they do it?)
  final_confidence: number,              // 1-10 (CSS final)
  final_action_clarity: number,          // 1-10 (CSS final)
  final_mindset_state: string,           // resistant/neutral/open/engaged
  user_satisfaction: number,             // 1-10 (CSS final)
  key_takeaway: string                   // Main insight
}
```

## 🎓 7 Confidence-Building Techniques

All implemented in the Ownership stage:

1. **Normalize Starting Point**: "3/10 is honest - we'll work on that together"
2. **Past Success Activation**: "Tell me about a time you handled change before"
3. **Reframe Resistance**: "Resistance is the REAL risk here"
4. **Specificity Reduces Fear**: "What's the REALISTIC worst case?"
5. **Personal Benefit Focus**: "What's in it for YOU personally?"
6. **Strength Bridging**: "You used [strength] then. You still have it now."
7. **Progress Celebration**: "That's a +4 point increase - real transformation!"

---

## 🔀 High-Confidence Branching Logic

### Trigger
```typescript
if (initial_confidence >= 8) {
  // Use HIGH-CONFIDENCE PATH
} else {
  // Use STANDARD PATH
}
```

### High-Confidence Path (3 Questions)
1. **Confidence Source**: "You're at 8/10 - that's strong! What's giving you that confidence?"
2. **Personal Benefit**: "What could you gain personally if you adapt well?"
3. **Past Success**: "Tell me about a time you successfully handled change before."

### Standard Path (7 Questions)
1. Explore fears
2. Challenge the catastrophe
3. Cost of staying stuck
4. Personal benefit (WIIFM)
5. Past success activation
6. Strength bridging
7. Confidence check

## 📈 CSS (Composite Success Score)

### Calculation
```
CSS = (Confidence Score × 0.4) + 
      (Action Score × 0.3) + 
      (Mindset Score × 0.2) + 
      (Satisfaction Score × 0.1)
```

### Success Levels
- **EXCELLENT** (85-100): Outstanding transformation
- **GOOD** (70-84): Strong progress with clear action
- **FAIR** (50-69): Meaningful progress, continue building
- **MARGINAL** (30-49): Some progress, may need support
- **INSUFFICIENT** (<30): Consider different approach

### Dimensions
1. **Confidence Transformation** (40% weight)
   - Measures: final_confidence - initial_confidence
   - Target: +4 points or more

2. **Action Clarity** (30% weight)
   - Measures: final_action_clarity score
   - Target: 8/10 or higher

3. **Mindset Shift** (20% weight)
   - Measures: initial_mindset_state → final_mindset_state
   - Target: Movement toward "engaged"

4. **Session Value** (10% weight)
   - Measures: user_satisfaction score
   - Target: 8/10 or higher
