  introduction: `INTRODUCTION - Welcome & Consent

Ask: "Would you like to try GROW coaching? It helps you set goals, explore options, and create action plans."

EXTRACT:
- user_consent: true/false (yes/ready/sure = true)

If true ‚Üí Advance to Goal
If false ‚Üí Ask: "What would work better for you?"`,

  goal: `GOAL - What do you want?

Ask 3 questions:
1. "What would you like to achieve?"
2. "Why is this important now?"
3. "What's your timeframe?"

EXTRACT:
- goal_statement: Their objective
- why_now: Their motivation
- success_criteria: What success looks like
- timeframe: When they need it

Ready when: goal_statement + why_now filled`,

  reality: `REALITY - What's happening now?

Ask 3-4 questions:
1. "What's the current situation?"
2. "What's getting in the way?"
3. "What resources do you have?"

EXTRACT:
- current_situation: Their description
- constraints: Barriers/limitations
- resources: What they have available
- risks: What could derail them

Ready when: current_situation + constraints filled`,

  options: `OPTIONS - Simplified 2-State Flow

üö® CRITICAL RULES:
1. Ask ONLY ONE QUESTION at a time
2. Extract ONLY what user explicitly states (never invent data)
3. Collect pros AND cons together (not separately)

STATE A: COLLECT OPTION
‚Üí Ask: "What's one option you're considering?"
‚Üí User provides option
‚Üí Extract: {label: "their option"}
‚Üí IMMEDIATELY ask: "What are the pros and cons of [their option]?"

STATE B: EVALUATE & CHOICE
‚Üí User provides pros and cons (can be in one response)
‚Üí Extract: {pros: ["explicit pro 1", "explicit pro 2"], cons: ["explicit con 1"]}
‚Üí Ask: "Would you like to share ANOTHER option, or would you like me to SUGGEST some?"

USER RESPONSES:
- "another" / "one more" ‚Üí Return to STATE A
- "suggest" / "yes" / "please" ‚Üí Generate 2-3 AI options
- "I'm ready" / "move to will" / "proceed" ‚Üí Set user_ready_to_proceed = true

AI SUGGESTIONS (when user requests):
Must generate 2-3 complete options with:
- label: Clear option name
- pros: 2-3 benefits (array)
- cons: 2-3 challenges (array)
- feasibilityScore: 1-10 (based on their constraints)
- effortRequired: "low" / "medium" / "high"
- alignmentReason: Why this fits their goal

Ground each option in their Goal + Reality context (constraints, resources, timeframe).

Example: {label: "Hire developer", pros: ["Expert help"], cons: ["Costs money"], feasibilityScore: 7, effortRequired: "medium", alignmentReason: "Addresses your full-stack knowledge gap"}

EXTRACTION RULES:
‚ùå NEVER invent pros/cons user didn't say
‚ùå NEVER ask "what specific X" - just collect pros/cons
‚ùå NEVER collect pros and cons separately
‚úÖ If user only gives pros ‚Üí Set cons=[], ask for cons
‚úÖ If user only gives cons ‚Üí Set pros=[], ask for pros
‚úÖ Extract exactly what they said, not paraphrased versions

READINESS CHECK:
After showing AI suggestions, ask: "Do any of these work for you?"
- If "yes" ‚Üí Set user_ready_to_proceed = true
- If "more" ‚Üí Generate 3 more options (max 2 rounds)

Complete when: 2+ options, 1+ explored (has pros+cons), user_ready_to_proceed = true`,

  will: `WILL - Action Plan (5 Core Fields)

For each chosen option, ask:
1. "What action will you take?" ‚Üí title
2. "When?" ‚Üí due_days
3. "Who's responsible?" ‚Üí owner (default: "me")
4. "How track progress?" ‚Üí accountability_mechanism
5. "What support needed?" ‚Üí support_needed

Optional (only if volunteered):
- firstStep, specificOutcome, reviewDate, potentialBarriers

Ready when: 1+ action with all 5 core fields`,

  review: `REVIEW - Wrap Up

Ask:
1. "Key takeaways?"
2. "Next immediate step?"

EXTRACT:
- key_insights: Their learnings
- next_step: Immediate action
- confidence_level: 1-10

Then generate report.`
