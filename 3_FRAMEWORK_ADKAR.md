# üîÑ ADKAR Framework: Change Leadership Implementation

**ADKAR** = **A**wareness ‚Üí **D**esire ‚Üí **K**nowledge ‚Üí **A**bility ‚Üí **R**einforcement

**Duration:** 20 minutes | **Steps:** 6 (5 + review) | **Best for:** Change management, adoption resistance, diagnosis

**Core Insight:** The LOWEST score is the barrier. Fix that barrier, not the symptoms.

---

## The 5 Stages

```
Awareness (1-5):  Do people understand WHY?
    ‚Üì
Desire (1-5):     Do people WANT to support it?
    ‚Üì
Knowledge (1-5):  Do people know HOW?
    ‚Üì
Ability (1-5):    Can people actually DO it?
    ‚Üì
Reinforcement (1-5): Will it STICK?
```

**Critical:** If Desire is 1 (they don't want it), giving training (Knowledge) won't help. Train at Desire barrier first.

---

## Step 1: AWARENESS (4 min)

**Rate 1‚Äì5: "Do they understand WHY this change is happening?"**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "From your perspective, why is the company making this change?"
2. "What problem is it trying to solve?"
3. "What happens if we don't change?"
4. "On a scale of 1‚Äì5, how well do you understand the WHY?"
5. "What part of the business case are you least clear on?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Do they understand the urgency?
- Do they know the business drivers?
- Can they explain it to someone else?

**If Score is 1‚Äì2:**
- **Barrier:** They don't understand WHY
- **Intervention:** Communicate business case, explain urgency, show consequences

**Coach Reflection:** "You rated yourself X. I'm hearing you understand [part] but are fuzzy on [part]. Is that right?"

---

## Step 2: DESIRE (4 min)

**Rate 1‚Äì5: "Do they WANT to support this change?"**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "How do you feel about this change? Be honest."
2. "What's in it for you personally?"
3. "What concerns or worries do you have?"
4. "On a scale of 1‚Äì5, how willing are you to participate?"
5. "What would make you more enthusiastic?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Is there resistance or openness?
- What are they afraid of?
- Do they see personal benefit?

**If Score is 1‚Äì2:**
- **Barrier:** Active resistance (don't want it)
- **Intervention:** Address fears, show personal benefit, create quick wins, get peer support

**Coach Reflection:** "I hear your concern about X. That's legitimate. But if we addressed Y, would that shift?"

---

## Step 3: KNOWLEDGE (4 min)

**Rate 1‚Äì5: "Do they know HOW to work in the new way?"**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "What training have you received?"
2. "Walk me through how you'll use the new system/process."
3. "What part confuses you?"
4. "On a scale of 1‚Äì5, how well do you understand HOW?"
5. "If you had to explain it to a colleague, what would you struggle with?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Have they been trained?
- Can they do it with reference materials?
- Do they understand the new process?

**If Score is 1‚Äì2:**
- **Barrier:** Insufficient training/clarity
- **Intervention:** Better training, documentation, practice, peer coaching, FAQs

**Coach Reflection:** "Your knowledge gap is clear. But notice‚ÄîDesire was X and Knowledge is Y. If Desire is low, training alone won't help."

---

## Step 4: ABILITY (4 min)

**Rate 1‚Äì5: "Can they actually DO it right now?"**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "Have you had chance to practice?"
2. "What makes it hard (or easy)?"
3. "Do you have the tools and access?"
4. "On a scale of 1‚Äì5, how able are you?"
5. "What's the biggest obstacle?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Can they do it under pressure?
- Are there environmental obstacles?
- Do they have support available?

**If Score is 1‚Äì2:**
- **Barrier:** Can't actually DO it yet
- **Intervention:** Practice time, remove obstacles, tools, safe learning environment, coaching support

**Coach Reflection:** "The obstacle is X, not your capability. If we addressed X, you'd get to proficiency quickly."

---

## Step 5: REINFORCEMENT (2 min)

**Rate 1‚Äì5: "Will this STICK?"**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "What will help make this change stick?"
2. "Will people revert to the old way?"
3. "What systems are in place to sustain it?"
4. "On a scale of 1‚Äì5, how confident this will stick?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Are there accountability systems?
- Is the old way still available?
- Is there feedback and recognition?

**If Score is 1‚Äì2:**
- **Barrier:** No reinforcement
- **Intervention:** Disable old way, add accountability, weekly check-ins, celebrate successes

---

## Step 6: REVIEW & DIAGNOSIS (2 min)

**Find the LOWEST score. That's your barrier.**

```
Example:
- Awareness: 3 (fuzzy on why)
- Desire: 2 (don't want it) ‚Üê LOWEST = BARRIER
- Knowledge: 3
- Ability: 2
- Reinforcement: 1

Barrier: DESIRE
Intervention: Address WHY people don't want it (fears, concerns, lack of personal benefit)
NOT: Give them more training (they won't use it if they don't want it)
```

**Barrier-Specific Interventions:**

| Barrier | Root Cause | Intervention |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Awareness** | Don't understand WHY | Communicate business case, show urgency |
| **Desire** | Don't WANT to | Address fears, show personal benefit, peer support |
| **Knowledge** | Don't know HOW | Training, documentation, practice, coaching |
| **Ability** | Can't DO it | Practice time, tools, safe environment, support |
| **Reinforcement** | Won't STICK | Accountability, disable old way, recognition |

## Real Session Example

```
Coach: "We're going to assess your readiness for this change."

AWARENESS:
Coach: "Why is the company making this change?"
Person: "To modernize... I think?"
Coach: "Rate your understanding 1‚Äì5."
Person: "3. I know something, but not the urgency."

DESIRE:
Coach: "How do you feel about it?"
Person: "Nervous. Worried about my job."
Coach: "Rate your willingness 1‚Äì5."
Person: "2. I'll do it if I have to, but I don't want to."

KNOWLEDGE:
Coach: "Do you know how to use the new system?"
Person: "I got training, but I forgot most."
Coach: "Rate your knowledge 1‚Äì5."
Person: "2."

ABILITY:
Coach: "Can you do it under pressure?"
Person: "No. We're too busy. No time to practice."
Coach: "Rate your ability 1‚Äì5."
Person: "1."

REINFORCEMENT:
Coach: "Will this stick?"
Person: "Probably not. I'll revert."
Coach: "Rate your confidence 1‚Äì5."
Person: "1."

DIAGNOSIS:
Coach: "Your scores are 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. Lowest is DESIRE at 2. That's your barrier."
Coach: "Before we train you (Knowledge), we need to address your fears about your job. Once you WANT this, everything else gets easier."
```

## Guardrails

‚ùå **Don't train someone who doesn't want it (Desire is low)**  
‚úÖ **Fix Desire first, THEN train**

‚ùå **Don't overestimate readiness**  
‚úÖ **Diagnose against reality, not hopes**

‚ùå **Don't skip Reinforcement**  
‚úÖ **Plan reinforcement from day 1**

‚ùå **Don't treat symptoms**  
‚úÖ **Find and fix the barrier**
