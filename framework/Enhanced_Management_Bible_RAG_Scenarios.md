## SCENARIO 1: The Art of Effective Delegation (ENHANCED)

**Category:** delegation  
**Tags:** delegation, empowerment, trust, micromanagement, accountability  
**Word Count:** ~1,200

### Core Principle

Delegation is not about dumping work on others—it's about developing your team while freeing yourself to focus on higher-level responsibilities. The 80/20 rule applies: 20% of results come from 80% of work. Your job is to orchestrate the team toward common goals, not to do the work yourself.

### The Delegation Hierarchy: 5 Levels of Control

**Level 1: Direct & Control**
- "Do exactly this, exactly this way"
- Use for: New employees, critical tasks, emergency situations
- Example: "Process this refund using steps 1-7 in the manual. Check with me before hitting 'submit'."

**Level 2: Investigate & Report**
- "Research this and give me your findings"
- Use for: Information gathering, market research, competitive analysis
- Example: "Survey 10 customers about their satisfaction with our checkout process. Report findings by Friday."

**Level 3: Recommend & Act**
- "Propose a solution, get my approval, then execute"
- Use for: Experienced employees learning decision-making
- Example: "Analyze the supplier proposals and recommend which to choose. We'll review together before signing."

**Level 4: Act & Report**
- "Make the decision, implement it, then inform me"
- Use for: Trusted employees on routine decisions
- Example: "You handle client scheduling conflicts. Just let me know what you decided."

**Level 5: Full Autonomy**
- "You own this completely"
- Use for: Expert employees in their domain
- Example: "The Q3 budget is yours. I trust your judgment."

### Tasks You Should ALWAYS Delegate

**1. Detail Work (80% of Effort, 20% of Results)**
- Formatting presentations
- Data entry and verification
- Scheduling and calendar management
- Expense report processing

**Why:** You're paid to orchestrate strategy, not shuffle pixels.

**How to Delegate Detail Work:**
```
TEMPLATE:
"I need [OUTCOME] completed by [DATE]. The format should be [SPECS]. 
Check [REFERENCE DOCUMENT] for examples. Questions before you start?"

EXAMPLE:
"I need this sales data formatted as a bar chart by Thursday 2pm. 
Use the same style as last month's report (link). 
Questions before you start?"
```

**2. Information Gathering**
- Competitive intelligence
- Industry research
- Customer feedback compilation
- Vendor comparison analysis

**Why:** Free yourself to analyze findings and devise strategy.

**How to Delegate Research:**
```
TEMPLATE:
"Research [TOPIC] and summarize: (1) Key findings, (2) Implications for us, 
(3) Your recommendations. Deadline: [DATE]. Sources to check: [LIST]."

EXAMPLE:
"Research pricing strategies for SaaS competitors in our space. 
Summarize: (1) Their pricing tiers, (2) How we compare, (3) Should we adjust?
Deadline: Next Tuesday. Check: ProfitWell, PricingSaaS, 5 competitors."
```

**3. Repetitive Assignments**
- Weekly status reports
- Recurring meetings you've attended 10+ times
- Standard client onboarding
- Routine quality checks

**Why:** Once you know how it works, teach someone else.

**Delegation Script:**
```
"I've done [TASK] for the past [X months]. You've seen how it works. 
Starting [DATE], you'll own it. Let's do one together, then you solo 
with my review, then you're fully independent. Questions?"
```

### The Delegation Discussion Framework

**STEP 1: Set Context (Why This Matters)**
```
"I'm delegating [TASK] because [REASON]. This is important because 
[BUSINESS IMPACT]. It's also a development opportunity for you to 
learn [SKILL]."

EXAMPLE:
"I'm delegating client onboarding to you because we're growing fast 
and I need to focus on closing new deals. This is important because 
our retention rate depends on great first impressions. It's also your 
chance to own the full client relationship."
```

**STEP 2: Clarify Expectations (What Success Looks Like)**
```
SPECIFIC: [Exact deliverable]
MEASURABLE: [How we'll know it's done well]
AUTHORITY: [What you can decide without me]
RESOURCES: [What you have access to]
TIMELINE: [When it's due, with check-ins]

EXAMPLE:
SPECIFIC: Complete onboarding calls with 5 new clients this week
MEASURABLE: Client submits satisfaction survey with 4+ stars
AUTHORITY: You can customize demo scripts, schedule follow-ups
RESOURCES: CRM access, onboarding playbook, my availability for escalations
TIMELINE: All calls done by Friday 5pm, check-in Wednesday at 2pm
```

**STEP 3: Confirm Understanding**
```
"Walk me through your understanding. What's your first step?"

Listen for:
- Do they understand the outcome?
- Do they know their authority level?
- Do they know where to get help?
- Are they confident or anxious? (Adjust support accordingly)
```

**STEP 4: Agree on Check-ins**
```
"Let's check in [FREQUENCY] to discuss progress. 
Between check-ins, flag issues if [CONDITIONS]."

EXAMPLE:
"Let's check in every Monday at 10am for 15 minutes. 
Between check-ins, flag me immediately if: (1) client threatens 
to cancel, (2) you need budget approval >$500, (3) you're stuck 
for more than 2 hours."
```

### Common Delegation Mistakes & Fixes

**MISTAKE #1: Reverse Delegation (Employee gives work back to you)**

**Signs:**
- "I tried but couldn't figure it out. Can you just do it?"
- "What should I do about X?" (for decisions they should make)
- "Can you review this before I continue?" (every 10 minutes)

**Fix:**
```
RESPONSE SCRIPT:
"Let's problem-solve together. What have you tried? 
What are your options? Which would you recommend? 
Why? Let's talk through your reasoning."

DO NOT: Take the work back. Solve it for them.
DO: Coach them through the thinking process.
```

**MISTAKE #2: Delegating Outcome but Not Authority**

**Signs:**
- Employee has to ask permission for every small decision
- "I wanted to [X] but wasn't sure if I could"
- Progress is bottlenecked waiting for your approval

**Fix:**
```
CLARIFY DECISION RIGHTS:
"Here's your decision authority:
- $0-500: You decide, no approval needed
- $501-2000: Propose to me, I'll approve quickly
- $2001+: We decide together

For non-financial decisions:
- Process changes: You decide
- Policy exceptions: Ask me first
- Strategic direction: We decide together"
```

**MISTAKE #3: Micromanaging the "How"**

**Signs:**
- You tell them exactly which steps to take
- You check in multiple times per day
- You redo their work "your way"

**Fix:**
```
SHIFT YOUR LANGUAGE:
❌ "Use this exact script..."
✅ "Here's one approach. What would you do differently?"

❌ "Did you complete step 3 yet?"
✅ "How's it going? On track for Friday?"

❌ "This isn't how I would've done it."
✅ "This achieves the goal. Nice work."
```

**MISTAKE #4: Delegating Tasks You Enjoy**

**Reality Check:**
- Delegation should develop your team AND free you for high-leverage work
- Don't delegate tasks you love just because you "should"
- Delegate tasks that: (1) develop others, (2) free you for strategy, (3) you're not uniquely good at

### The "Trust But Verify" Balance

**Early Stages (First 1-3 Times):**
- Check-ins: 2-3 times per project
- Review: Before they deliver to stakeholders
- Message: "I'm here to support you"

**Middle Stages (Times 4-10):**
- Check-ins: Once per project
- Review: Spot-check 25% of deliverables
- Message: "I trust you, flagging exceptions"

**Mastery (Time 11+):**
- Check-ins: As-needed, they drive
- Review: None unless they request
- Message: "You own this"

### When Delegation Goes Wrong: Recovery Scripts

**SCENARIO: They miss a deadline**
```
"Let's debrief: What got in the way? What would you do differently next time?
How can I support you better? Do we need to adjust the timeline going forward?"

DON'T: "Why didn't you tell me?" (defensive)
DO: "What signals should I watch for next time?" (future-focused)
```

**SCENARIO: Quality doesn't meet expectations**
```
"This doesn't meet our standard for [SPECIFIC REASON]. Let me show you 
what good looks like [SHARE EXAMPLE]. Can you rework sections 2 and 4? 
Let's review together before you tackle the rest."

DON'T: Take it back and do it yourself
DO: Teach them what good looks like, then let them fix it
```

**SCENARIO: They say "I don't have time"**
```
"Let's look at your priorities together. What can we defer or delegate 
to make room? This is priority #[X] for the team."

If truly overloaded: Adjust scope or deadline
If poor time management: Coach on prioritization
```

### The 80% Solution Principle

**Key Insight:** Their 80% solution done independently is better than your 100% solution requiring constant involvement.

**Why?**
1. **Scalability:** You can't be everywhere at once
2. **Development:** They learn by doing (imperfectly)
3. **Ownership:** When they create it, they own it
4. **Your Time:** Frees you for work only you can do

**When to Accept 80%:**
- Internal deliverables (reports, analyses)
- Routine client interactions
- Process work that doesn't directly impact revenue/reputation

**When to Require 100%:**
- External communications to key stakeholders
- Legal/compliance matters
- Crisis situations
- First impressions (client onboarding, interviews)

### Delegation Success Metrics

Track these to improve your delegation skills:

1. **Time Freed:** Hours per week you've reclaimed for strategic work
2. **Team Skill Growth:** What can your team do now that they couldn't 6 months ago?
3. **Quality Ratio:** What % of delegated work meets standards without rework?
4. **Autonomy Level:** What % of your team operates at Level 4-5?
5. **Your Stress:** Are you working reasonable hours? Taking vacation?

**Target:** Within 6 months, 80% of routine work should be at Level 4-5 delegation.

### Final Checklist: Before You Delegate

✅ Have I explained WHY this matters (context)?  
✅ Have I defined what SUCCESS looks like (outcome, not process)?  
✅ Have I clarified DECISION AUTHORITY (what they can decide alone)?  
✅ Have I identified RESOURCES available (budget, tools, people)?  
✅ Have I agreed on CHECK-IN cadence (not too little, not too much)?  
✅ Have I confirmed their UNDERSTANDING ("Walk me through...")?  
✅ Have I committed to COACHING not RESCUING (teach, don't do)?

## SCENARIO 2: Giving Effective Feedback (ENHANCED)

**Category:** feedback  
**Tags:** feedback, difficult_conversations, performance, communication, recognition  
**Word Count:** ~1,400

### The Core Problem with Feedback

**What managers think:** "I give feedback all the time"  
**What employees say:** 58% seldom or never receive thanks from their manager  
**The gap:** Managers overestimate their feedback frequency and quality

### The #1 Feedback Rule: Make Praise Immediate, Specific, and Pure

**❌ WRONG (Contaminated Praise):**
"You did a great job on this report, BUT there were quite a few typos."

**Why it fails:** The word "but" erases everything before it. The employee only hears "typos."

**✅ RIGHT (Pure Praise):**
"You did a great job on this report. The analysis was thorough and the recommendations were actionable."

[SEPARATE CONVERSATION, different time]
"I noticed several typos in the last report. Can we talk about proofreading strategies?"

### The Feedback Sandwich: Why It Fails

**The Formula:** Positive + Negative + Positive  
**The Theory:** Softens criticism with praise

**Why It Doesn't Work:**

1. **Employees Learn to Ignore Praise**
   - They wait for the "but"
   - Praise becomes meaningless filler
   - Trust erodes ("What are they really trying to say?")

2. **The Negative Gets Diluted**
   - Message isn't clear
   - Employee doesn't realize severity
   - Behavior doesn't change

3. **Feels Manipulative**
   - Employees see through it
   - "My manager is using that technique on me"
   - Reduces psychological safety

4. **Confuses the Message**
   - What's the actual point?
   - Should I feel good or bad?
   - What specifically should I change?

### The DIRECT, KIND Feedback Model

**FORMULA:**
1. State the SPECIFIC behavior (what you observed)
2. Explain the IMPACT (consequences)
3. Request the CHANGE (what you need instead)
4. Offer SUPPORT (how you'll help)

**SCRIPT TEMPLATE:**
```
"[SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR]. [IMPACT]. [REQUEST]. [SUPPORT]?"

"In yesterday's meeting, you interrupted Sarah three times while 
she was explaining the API delay. This makes her reluctant to raise 
issues early, which means we miss problems until it's too late. 
I need you to let people finish their thoughts. Would it help if 
I gave you a signal when you're interrupting?"
```

### 7 Feedback Situations with Exact Scripts

**SITUATION 1: Missed Deadline (No Advance Warning)**

```
SETUP: Private conversation, calm tone

"The Q3 report was due Friday at 5pm. You submitted it Monday at 11am 
without advance notice. This delayed our board presentation and created 
last-minute stress for the exec team. I need 48-hour warning if you'll 
miss a deadline so we can adjust plans. What happened here?"

[LISTEN TO THEIR EXPLANATION]

"Going forward, if you realize you'll miss a deadline:
1. Tell me immediately (don't wait hoping you'll catch up)
2. Propose a new ETA
3. Explain what's blocking you
4. Ask if I can help remove obstacles

Can you commit to this?"
```

**SITUATION 2: Quality Issues (Repeated Errors)**

```
"I've noticed 5 calculation errors in the financial models you've submitted 
over the past month [SHOW EXAMPLES]. These errors reached the CFO twice, 
which damages our department's credibility. I need error rates below 1% 
before documents leave our team. Let's figure out what's causing this. 
Are you:
- Rushing due to time pressure?
- Unclear on the formulas?
- Not using the check process?

What support do you need to improve accuracy?"
```

**SITUATION 3: Poor Meeting Behavior (Disengagement)**

```
"In the last three stand-ups, you've been on your laptop the whole time, 
typing emails. When Sarah asked you a direct question, you had to ask 
her to repeat it. This signals to the team that you don't value their time. 
I need you to close your laptop and engage in meetings. If the meeting 
isn't valuable, let's discuss whether you should attend. But if you're 
there, be present. Agreed?"
```

**SITUATION 4: Communication Style (Too Blunt)**

```
"When you told Jake his code was 'a mess' in the team Slack, he felt 
embarrassed and defensive. I saw him withdraw from the conversation 
immediately. The quality issue was real, but the delivery shut down 
collaboration. Instead of 'this is a mess,' try: 'I see a few areas we 
could clean up. Want to pair on this?' Can you commit to that approach?"
```

**SITUATION 5: Attitude Problem (Negative/Complaining)**

```
"I've heard you say in the past week: 'This project is doomed,' 'Leadership 
has no idea what they're doing,' and 'Why do we even bother?' Your team 
hears this and morale drops. They start believing nothing matters. If 
you have concerns about direction, bring them to me privately and we'll 
address them. But in team spaces, I need you to be constructive. If you 
can't find a way to be positive, we need to discuss whether this role 
still fits. What's going on?"
```

**SITUATION 6: Inappropriate Behavior (Boundary Cross)**

```
"Yesterday you made a comment about Sarah's appearance in the break room. 
[QUOTE THE SPECIFIC COMMENT]. Regardless of intent, comments about 
appearance create discomfort and risk harassment claims. Our policy 
is clear: No comments on appearance, period. This is your official 
warning. If it happens again, we'll involve HR. Do you understand?"

[DOCUMENT THIS CONVERSATION IMMEDIATELY]
```

**SITUATION 7: Lack of Initiative (Passive)**

```
"Over the past month, you've completed assigned tasks but haven't 
proposed any improvements or flagged emerging issues. For your level, 
I expect proactive thinking: 'I noticed X problem, here's my proposed 
solution.' Let's start with one area you can take initiative. Where 
do you see an opportunity to improve our process?"
```

### Handling Defensive Reactions

**REACTION 1: Denial ("I didn't do that")**
```
SCRIPT:
"Let me share the specific examples I observed: [PROVIDE DETAILS WITH 
DATES, TIMES]. I'm not making assumptions—I saw this directly. 
Help me understand your perspective."

DON'T: Argue about "did you or didn't you"
DO: Focus on observable facts and impact
```

**REACTION 2: Excuses ("It's not my fault")**
```
SCRIPT:
"I hear that external factors played a role. Let's separate what you 
control from what you don't. What could YOU have done differently, 
regardless of circumstances?"

DON'T: Accept blanket excuses
DO: Acknowledge constraints while focusing on their agency
```

**REACTION 3: Emotional ("This isn't fair!")**
```
SCRIPT:
"I can see you're upset. Take a moment. This feedback is about helping 
you succeed, not attacking you personally. When you're ready, let's 
discuss how to move forward."

DON'T: Continue when emotions are high
DO: Pause, show empathy, resume when calm
```

**REACTION 4: Counter-Attack ("Well YOU do X...")**
```
SCRIPT:
"I'm open to feedback about my performance in a separate conversation. 
Right now, we're discussing your [BEHAVIOR]. Can we focus on that?"

DON'T: Get derailed into defending yourself
DO: Acknowledge and redirect
```

### The Recognition Gap

**Research Finding:** Recognition is the most motivating incentive employees report, yet 58% seldom receive it.

**Why Managers Don't Recognize Enough:**

1. **Assume employees know:** "They know I appreciate them"
2. **Waiting for perfection:** "I'll praise when they exceed expectations"
3. **Too busy:** "I'll thank them later" (then forget)
4. **Awkward:** "I don't want to seem cheesy"

### The 5:1 Ratio Rule

**For every 1 correction, give 5 recognitions**

**Why?**
- Psychologically, negative feedback is 5x more impactful than positive
- Balance maintains morale
- Employees need to know what to KEEP doing, not just what to STOP

### Creative Recognition Methods (Beyond Money)

**Immediate Recognition (Do This Daily):**
1. **Verbal Thank You** - Specific, immediate, genuine
   - "Thanks for staying late to finish the client deck. That saved us."

2. **Public Acknowledgment** - In team meetings, Slack channels
   - "Shoutout to Maria for debugging the payment issue in 2 hours"

3. **Handwritten Note** - Rare in digital age, feels special
   - Write a 3-sentence note thanking them for specific contribution

**Weekly Recognition:**
1. **Spotlight Email** - Send to your boss, cc the employee
   - "FYI: Jake resolved 15 support tickets this week, 20% above average"

2. **Peer Recognition** - Ask team to nominate each other
   - "Friday kudos: Who helped you most this week?"

**Monthly/Quarterly Recognition:**
1. **Choice Assignment** - Let high performers pick next project
   - "You've earned first choice on the Q4 initiatives"

2. **Development Opportunity** - Fund conference, training, certification
   - "Congrats on the promotion. Here's $2K for AWS cert prep"

3. **Extra Time Off** - Reward results with flexibility
   - "Take Friday off. You've earned it after the product launch."

### Feedback Frequency Guidelines

**HIGH PERFORMERS:**
- Positive feedback: Weekly
- Developmental feedback: Monthly
- Formal review: Quarterly

**AVERAGE PERFORMERS:**
- Positive feedback: 2x per week
- Developmental feedback: Bi-weekly
- Formal review: Quarterly

**STRUGGLING PERFORMERS:**
- Positive feedback: Daily (catch them doing ANYTHING right)
- Developmental feedback: Weekly (structured improvement plan)
- Formal review: Bi-weekly (close monitoring)

### The "Catch People Doing Things Right" System

**SETUP:**
1. Set a daily reminder: "Have I praised anyone today?"
2. Keep a "wins log" - note small achievements you observe
3. Share at least one specific recognition per day

**EXAMPLES OF "SMALL" WINS TO RECOGNIZE:**
- Helped a colleague solve a problem
- Took initiative on something without being asked
- Met a deadline early
- Improved a process
- Asked a great question in a meeting
- Handled a difficult customer gracefully
- Stayed calm under pressure

### Feedback Documentation Template

**For developmental/corrective feedback, document using this format:**

```
FEEDBACK DOCUMENTATION

Date: [DATE]
Employee: [NAME]
Issue: [One-sentence description]

Specific Behavior Observed:
- [What they did, when, where]

Impact/Consequences:
- [Business impact]
- [Team impact]
- [Customer impact]

Feedback Given:
- [What you told them]
- [Their response]

Expectations Going Forward:
- [Specific behavior change required]
- [Timeline for improvement]
- [Support/resources offered]

Next Check-In:

Manager Signature: _______
Employee Acknowledgment: _______ (they don't need to agree, just acknowledge discussion occurred)
```

**When to Document:**
- First time discussing a performance concern
- Any behavioral issue (always document)
- When you say "This is your warning"
- Before moving to formal discipline

### Final Feedback Checklist

**Before Giving Critical Feedback:**
✅ Can I provide specific examples (dates, quotes, observable behaviors)?  
✅ Have I checked my emotional state (am I calm)?  
✅ Is this private (not in front of others)?  
✅ Do I have time for a full conversation (not rushed)?  
✅ Have I prepared support to offer (not just criticism)?  
✅ Am I ready to listen to their perspective?  
✅ Will I document this conversation?  

**After Giving Feedback:**
✅ Did I document the conversation?  
✅ Did I set a clear follow-up date?  
✅ Did I end on a constructive note?  
✅ Do they know what success looks like?  
✅ Have I provided the resources/support promised?

## SCENARIO 3: Handling Chronic Underperformance (ENHANCED)

**Category:** performance_management  
**Tags:** underperformance, pip, performance_improvement, documentation, difficult_conversations  
**Word Count:** ~1,300

### When Performance Feedback Isn't Working

**Red Flags You're Dealing with Chronic Underperformance:**

1. **Pattern Over Time:** 3+ months of below-standard work
2. **Multiple Conversations:** You've given feedback 2+ times with no improvement
3. **Documented Examples:** You have specific instances with dates
4. **Impact on Team:** Others are picking up their slack or morale is suffering
5. **No Acknowledgment:** Employee denies there's a problem or blames others

### The SBIR Conversation Framework

**SBIR = Situation-Behavior-Impact-Request**

**Example Script:**
```
SITUATION: "In the Q3 project..."

BEHAVIOR: "...you missed 3 out of 4 milestones. Specifically:
- Code review deadline (Sept 15): Delivered Sept 22
- Feature completion (Sept 30): Delivered Oct 8  
- Testing handoff (Oct 7): Delivered Oct 15"

IMPACT: "This delayed our client delivery by 2 weeks, jeopardized our 
contract renewal, and forced the team to work weekends to catch up. 
The product manager received direct complaints from the client."

REQUEST: "I need you to meet agreed deadlines OR flag issues 48 hours 
in advance if you'll miss one. No surprises. Can you commit to this?"
```

**Why SBIR Works:**
- **Specific:** Not vague ("you're unreliable"), but concrete data
- **Observable:** Behavior anyone could see, not assumptions about intent
- **Impact-focused:** Shows consequences, not just rule-breaking
- **Actionable:** Clear what needs to change

### The 30-60-90 Day Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

**Purpose:** Give employee clear path to success OR clear timeline to exit

**30-Day Goals: Initial Improvement**
- 2-3 specific, measurable objectives
- Weekly check-ins (scheduled, documented)
- Clear success criteria

**Example 30-Day Goals:**
```
GOAL 1: Meet 100% of deadlines OR notify manager 48hrs in advance
- Success: 0 missed deadlines without notice
- Measurement: Project tracker timestamps

GOAL 2: Code passes first QA review with ≤2 bugs (down from average of 8)
- Success: Average bugs ≤2 across 3 submissions
- Measurement: QA bug reports

GOAL 3: Attend all scheduled stand-ups (currently 60% attendance)
- Success: 100% attendance or advance approval for absence
- Measurement: Meeting attendance log
```

**60-Day Goals: Sustained Progress**
- Building on 30-day success
- Reduced check-in frequency (bi-weekly if improving)
- Demonstrating consistency

**90-Day Assessment: Final Decision**
- Has performance reached acceptable standard?
- Is improvement trajectory positive?
- Decision: Continue employment OR separate

### Critical Documentation Requirements

**What to Document (Every Single Time):**

1. **Date and Time** of conversation
2. **Specific Examples** with dates/details
3. **What You Said** (paraphrase key points)
4. **Employee Response** (their explanation/reaction)
5. **Agreed Action Items** (specific and measurable)
6. **Timeline** for next check-in
7. **Support Provided** (training, resources, coaching offered)
8. **Consequences** if no improvement

**Documentation Template:**
```
PERFORMANCE DOCUMENTATION

Date: October 15, 2025, 2:00 PM
Location: Conference Room B
Attendees: [Manager Name], [Employee Name]

Issue Summary:
Chronic missed deadlines (3 instances in Q3)

Specific Examples:
1. Sept 15 deadline missed by 7 days (no advance notice)
2. Sept 30 deadline missed by 8 days (no advance notice)
3. Oct 7 deadline missed by 8 days (claimed unaware of deadline)

Business Impact:

4. Use project tracker to update status daily

Support Provided:
- Access to time management training (LinkedIn Learning)
- Daily 10-min check-ins for first 2 weeks
- Manager will help prioritize if workload overwhelming

Timeline:
- 30-day review: November 15, 2025
- Weekly check-ins every Friday at 3pm
- Expectation: Zero missed deadlines in next 30 days

Consequences:
If performance doesn't improve by 30-day review, will move to 
formal Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with potential termination 
at 90 days.

Employee Response:
[Employee Name] acknowledged understanding of expectations and 
committed to improvement. Expressed feeling overwhelmed but agrees 
current approach isn't working.

Manager Signature: _____________ Date: _______
Employee Signature: _____________ Date: _______ 
(Signature indicates discussion occurred, not necessarily agreement)
```

### Red Flags: When to Exit Early

**Don't wait full 90 days if you see:**

1. **No Improvement After 60 Days**
   - Pattern unchanged despite clear expectations
   - Multiple documented conversations

2. **Defensive/Blaming Behavior**
   - Consistently blames others
   - Makes excuses without taking ownership
   - "It's not my fault because..."

3. **Negative Impact on Team**
   - Team morale declining
   - Others complaining or doing their work
   - Good employees considering leaving

4. **Unwillingness to Acknowledge Problem**
   - "I don't see an issue"
   - "You're targeting me unfairly"
   - "Everyone else does this too"

5. **Integrity Issues**
   - Lying about completion status
   - Falsifying reports
   - Claiming credit for others' work

**Exit Script When Continuing is Futile:**
```
"We've had three documented conversations about [ISSUE] over the past 
60 days. Despite clear expectations, support, and weekly check-ins, 
the performance issues continue. At this point, I don't believe this 
role is the right fit. We'll be ending your employment effective 
[DATE]. Here's information about your final paycheck, benefits, and 
next steps."

[Have HR present for this conversation]
```

### Troubleshooting Common Underperformance Scenarios

**SCENARIO 1: High Performer Suddenly Struggling**

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "Your performance has been excellent for 2 years, but I've noticed 
  a change in the past 2 months. Is everything okay?"
- "What's different? Workload? Personal situation? Team dynamics?"
- "How can I support you in getting back on track?"

**Likely Causes:**
- Personal crisis (divorce, illness, family issues)
- Burnout from overwork
- Team conflict
- Loss of motivation/engagement
- Health issues

**Approach:**
- Empathy first, performance second
- Offer EAP (Employee Assistance Program) if personal issues
- Adjust workload temporarily if burnout
- Address team issues if interpersonal conflict
- Focus on recovery, not punishment

**SCENARIO 2: Never Been High Performer (Wrong Hire)**

**Signs:**
- Struggling from day one
- Needs constant hand-holding
- Other team members more advanced after less time
- Skills don't match job requirements

**Diagnostic:**
- "Let's assess whether this role aligns with your strengths"
- Review job description vs actual skills
- Honest conversation: "Is this what you expected?"

**Approach:**
- Might be wrong role, not bad employee
- Explore if different position better fit
- If no fit anywhere, exit compassionately
- "This isn't working out" is okay if truly mismatched

**SCENARIO 3: Personal Issues Affecting Work**

**Balance:**
- Be compassionate about personal situation
- Hold them accountable for work impact
- Offer accommodations where possible
- Set clear expectations and timeline

**Script:**
```
"I understand you're dealing with [SITUATION] and I'm sorry you're 
going through that. We can be flexible on [X], but I still need 
[Y DELIVERABLE] by [DATE]. What support would help you succeed 
despite the circumstances? If you need leave under FMLA, let's 
discuss with HR."
```

**SCENARIO 4: Skills Gap (Trainable)**

**Signs:**
- Effort is there, results aren't
- Specific technical deficiency
- Willing to learn
- Coachable attitude

**Approach:**
- Invest in training (online courses, mentoring, pair programming)
- Set 60-day skill development plan
- Provide resources and time to learn
- Measure progress weekly

**Different from general underperformance:** This is fixable with training

### Legal Considerations (Involve HR!)

**When to Loop in HR:**
- Before placing someone on formal PIP
- If employee claims discrimination
- If termination likely
- Any behavior that could be harassment
- If employee requests ADA accommodation
- Before any final termination decision

**Legal Do's:**
- ✅ Document everything
- ✅ Apply policies consistently
- ✅ Focus on observable behaviors and results
- ✅ Provide clear expectations and reasonable time to improve
- ✅ Show you offered support and resources

**Legal Don'ts:**
- ❌ Make assumptions about why (stick to what you observed)
- ❌ Compare to other employees by name
- ❌ Make it personal ("you're lazy")
- ❌ Fire without documentation
- ❌ Treat protected classes differently

### The Compassionate Exit

**When all else fails and termination is necessary:**

```
SCRIPT:
"[Name], we've had multiple conversations about [ISSUE] over [TIME PERIOD]. 
Despite clear expectations and support, the performance hasn't improved 
to the level needed for this role. We've made the difficult decision to 
end your employment, effective [DATE].

Here's what happens next:
- Final paycheck includes [X days] pay plus [Y days] PTO
- Benefits continue through [DATE]
- We'll provide [severance/package] details
- HR will discuss COBRA, references, and final logistics

I know this is difficult. I want you to succeed, and I believe you will 
in a role that better matches your strengths. I'm happy to serve as a 
reference for [SPECIFIC STRENGTHS].

Do you have questions?"
```

**Tone:** Firm but respectful. Not angry, not apologetic—just factual.

**Logistics:**
- Have HR present
- Have box for personal items
- Disable system access immediately after meeting
- Security escort if any concern about reaction
- Conduct early in week (not Friday)
- Offer references for genuine strengths (if appropriate)
