# Professional Coaching Framework Integration

## ‚úÖ Enhanced with Evidence-Based Coaching Methodology

CoachFlux now incorporates professional performance coaching principles from **Ois√≠n Performance Coaching** methodology.

---

## üéØ Coaching Philosophy

### Core Definition
Coaching is a process whereby one individual helps another to perform, learn and achieve at a superior level through:

- **Increasing self-responsibility and ownership** within individuals and teams
- **Unlocking their ability** and potential
- **Increasing awareness** of factors which determine performance
- **Assisting to identify and remove barriers** to achievement  
- **Enabling individuals and teams to self-coach**

---

## üîë Core Coaching Principles

### 1. Above and Below the Line
**Above the Line:** Ownership, Accountability, Responsibility  
**Below the Line:** Blame, Excuses, Denial

The coach facilitates movement from below-the-line to above-the-line thinking.

### 2. Focus Areas
- **Focus on BEHAVIOUR** rather than the person
- **Focus on OBSERVATIONS** rather than inference
- **Focus on DESCRIPTIONS** rather than judgments
- **Share ideas and explore alternatives**, not just give advice

### 3. Effective Feedback Principles
- Provide feedback frequently
- Provide feedback in a timely manner
- Focus on behaviour rather than on the person
- Focus on observations rather than inference
- Focus on descriptions rather than judgments
- Share ideas and explore alternatives, rather than only giving advice

## üìä The GROW Model (Enhanced)

### Structure: Expand ‚Üí Focus

The GROW coaching conversation is a **structured process of expanding upon, and then focusing in on information**.

```
Goal ‚Üí Reality ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Wrap-up
  ‚Üì        ‚Üì        ‚Üì        ‚Üì
Expand ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Focus
```

### Question Sequence

1. **What do we want to talk about?** (Topic)
2. **What outcomes would we like to achieve from this conversation?** (Goal)
3. **What's actually happening?** (Reality)
4. **What can be done about it?** (Options)
5. **What are you going to do about it?** (Wrap-up/Will)

## üéì GROW Phase Details

### Goal Phase
**Objective:** Clarify the Topic and Goal

**Coaching Guidance:**
- Clarify: "What is it you wish to discuss?"

**Implemented Prompts:**
- What is it you wish to discuss?
- What outcomes would you like to achieve from this conversation?

- Once you have developed a number of options, start to **evaluate which option is most likely to yield the best outcome(s)**

**Implemented Prompts:**
- What are the possible ways forward?

- What would you do if there were no constraints?

---
