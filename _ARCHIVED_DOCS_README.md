## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Do NOT Use Archived Files
The archived documentation describes the OLD 6-stage model which is no longer implemented. Using this documentation will cause confusion and errors.

### Migration Path
If you have old sessions or references:
1. Review `COMPASS_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` for the new structure
2. Update any external documentation to reference new files
3. Use the new 4-stage + Introduction model going forward

**Recommendation**: Keep archived for 30 days, then delete if no issues arise.
