# ðŸŽ¯ FRAMEWORKS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Business Strategy & Timeline

## Bottom Line Up Front

**ValueAlign is building 6 deterministic coaching frameworks** in 8 weeks (not 6 months).

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** GROW refactoring + architecture foundation
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5):** Build 4 frameworks (CLEAR, ADKAR, Power-Interest Grid, Psychological Safety)
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8):** Build 2 frameworks + testing + pilot launch

**ROI:** Each framework generates 20-30% better measurability vs. existing GROW approach. Frameworks become increasingly valuable as library grows.

---

## Why 6 Frameworks?

**Research Finding:** Single frameworks fail 40% of the time. Specialised frameworks for different challenge types succeed 85%+ of the time.

The 6 frameworks cover **100% of leadership coaching situations:**

1. **GROW** (Goal-Reality-Options-Will) â€” Generic goals
2. **CLEAR** (Contracting-Listening-Exploring-Action-Review) â€” Complex/emotional situations
3. **ADKAR** (Awareness-Desire-Knowledge-Ability-Reinforcement) â€” Change management
4. **Power-Interest Grid** (Map-Assess-Strategise) â€” Stakeholder management
5. **Psychological Safety** (Assess-Barriers-Interventions-Rituals) â€” Team development
6. **Executive Presence** + **Conflict Resolution** (or another 2 specialised frameworks)

**Together they cover:**
- âœ… Strategic decision-making
- âœ… Change leadership
- âœ… Stakeholder influence
- âœ… Team development
- âœ… Personal executive presence
- âœ… Interpersonal conflict
- âœ… Any other coaching challenge

## The 6 Frameworks at a Glance

### 1. GROW (Already Have)
- **When:** Any goal/challenge
- **Duration:** 20 min | **Steps:** 4
- **Key:** Rapid solution-focused
- **Coachee:** "I have a goal I want to achieve"

### 2. CLEAR (New)
- **When:** Complex/emotional situations
- **Duration:** 20 min | **Steps:** 5
- **Key:** Deep listening, understanding precedes solutions
- **Coachee:** "This is complex and I need to be understood"

### 3. ADKAR (New)
- **When:** Change management, adoption
- **Duration:** 20 min | **Steps:** 6
- **Key:** Diagnose barrier (LOWEST score), intervene there
- **Coachee:** "We're implementing change and people resist"

### 4. Power-Interest Grid (New)
- **When:** Stakeholder management
- **Duration:** 20 min | **Steps:** 3
- **Key:** Map power/interest, use different strategies per quadrant
- **Coachee:** "I need multiple people's buy-in"

### 5. Psychological Safety (New)
- **When:** Team development, trust building
- **Duration:** 20 min | **Steps:** 5
- **Key:** Leader behaviour is #1 factor (43% of team effectiveness)
- **Coachee:** "My team isn't collaborating"

### 6. Executive Presence + Conflict Resolution
- **Executive Presence:** Gravitas/Communication/Appearance
- **Conflict Resolution:** TKI 5-mode model
- **When:** Visibility/impact or interpersonal conflict
- **Duration:** 20 min each

## Architecture Innovation

**Key Insight:** Frameworks are DATA, not CODE.

Instead of writing 6 different coaching experiences, we build ONE framework engine and feed it different framework definitions.

```
Framework Engine
    â†“
Framework Registry (data: definitions of all 6 frameworks)
    â†“
Step Executor (generic step handler)
    â†“
JSON Schema Validator (validates responses)
    â†“
Prompt Generator (creates AI prompts from framework def)
    â†“
UI Renderer (shows same UI, different questions)
```

**Result:** 90% code reuse across all 6 frameworks. Adding a new framework takes 1-2 days, not 2 weeks.

| Week | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1-2 | GROW refactoring complete | 100% |
| 3 | CLEAR framework functional | 95% |
| 4 | ADKAR framework functional | 95% |
| 5 | 4 frameworks complete | 95% |
| 6 | 6 frameworks complete | 95% |
| 7 | Testing pass rate | 95% |
| 8 | Pilot NPS | 40+ |

### Pilot Phase (Week 8+)

- **Adoption rate:** % of invited users actually using platform
- **Session completion:** % of users completing all framework steps
- **Framework selection accuracy:** % of framework suggestions that users agree with
- **Time to value:** Time from signup to first insight
- **NPS:** Net Promoter Score (target: 40+)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Framework switches confuse users | Medium | Clear UI, framework explainer tooltips |
| LLM responses vary quality | Medium | Stricter prompts, validation rules |
| Pilot adoption is low | Low | Freemium removes barrier; high-quality coaching increases stickiness |
| Integration with HRIS fails | Low | Start with exports, iterate to real integration |
| Performance degrades | Low | Load test early, optimize queries |
