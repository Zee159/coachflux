# GROW Framework: OPTIONS & WILL Step Issues - Deep Dive Analysis

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Analyst:** AI Assistant (Claude)  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

After deep analysis of your GROW framework implementation, I've identified **critical issues** in both the OPTIONS and WILL steps that are preventing the AI from following your specifications exactly. The main problems are:

1. **OPTIONS Step:** Overly complex 4-state flow causing AI confusion and loops
2. **WILL Step:** Too many required fields (9 total) creating cognitive overload
3. **Completion Logic:** Conflicting requirements between prompts and coach validation
4. **AI Behavior:** LLM not adhering to strict state transitions and field extraction rules

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **Issue #1: OPTIONS Step - Overcomplicated State Machine**

**Problem:**  
The 4-state flow (Label → Pros → Cons → Fork) is causing the AI to:
- Misinterpret benefits as new options
- Ask for information already provided
- Loop endlessly asking for pros/cons
- Auto-generate data instead of extracting from user responses

**Evidence from Prompts (lines 486-750):**
```typescript
// STATE 1: Collect Label
// STATE 2: Collect Pros  
// STATE 3: Collect Cons
// STATE 4: Offer Fork

// 🚨 PROBLEM: Too many state transitions for LLM to track reliably
```

**Why This Fails:**
- LLMs struggle with complex state machines across multiple turns
- The AI must remember: "Am I in STATE 2 or STATE 3?" → Often gets confused
- Context window limitations cause state loss after 5-7 turns
- The "CRITICAL RULE" comments are not enforceable by the LLM

**Real Production Bug Example (from prompts line 693):**
```
❌ WRONG EXAMPLE - Misinterpreting benefits as new option:
User: "i could find someone to help me build"
AI: "What benefits do you see?"
User: "i might be able to go to market and have a working product"
AI: Treats "go to market" as NEW OPTION instead of a BENEFIT
```

---

### **Issue #2: OPTIONS Step - Auto-Generation of Data**

**Problem:**  
The AI is inventing pros/cons that users never stated, violating the rule to "ONLY extract what user EXPLICITLY stated."

**Evidence from Prompts (line 460):**
```typescript
🚨 CRITICAL RULE #3: NEVER auto-generate pros/cons that user didn't explicitly provide!
- ❌ NEVER invent cons like "Might require finding right person"
- ❌ NEVER infer pros like "Get additional support" unless user said those exact words
```

**Why This Fails:**
- LLMs are trained to be "helpful" by filling in gaps
- The prompt says "NEVER" but LLMs often ignore absolute prohibitions when being generative
- No structural enforcement prevents hallucinated data
- The AI prioritizes conversational flow over strict data extraction

---

### **Issue #3: OPTIONS Step - user_ready_to_proceed Not Triggering**

**Problem:**  
The completion logic requires `user_ready_to_proceed = true` to advance, but the AI is not consistently setting this field.

**Evidence from Coach Logic (grow.ts line 156):**
```typescript
return { 
  shouldAdvance: hasBasicRequirements && userReady === true
};
```

**Evidence from Prompts (line 419):**
```typescript
🚨 CRITICAL RULE #0: ALWAYS CHECK IF USER WANTS TO PROCEED TO WILL STEP FIRST!
Before doing ANYTHING else, check if user said:
- "proceed to will", "let's proceed", "continue", "I'm ready"
```

**Why This Fails:**
- The AI must detect intent from varied natural language
- Multiple conflicting rules: "Ask ONE question" vs "Check if ready to proceed FIRST"
- The field extraction happens AFTER response generation, not before
- No explicit training on this specific field makes it easy to forget

---

### **Issue #4: OPTIONS Step - Iterative Suggestion Flow Too Complex**

**Problem:**  
The 3-round AI suggestion system (2+3+3=8 options) with counting logic is causing errors.

**Evidence from Prompts (lines 597-667):**
```typescript
**COUNTING RULES:**
- User-provided options DO NOT count toward AI suggestion rounds
- AI can generate up to 8 options total across 3 AI rounds: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
- Track AI-generated options separately from user-provided options
```

**Why This Fails:**
- LLMs cannot reliably count and track state across multiple turns
- "User options vs AI options" distinction requires perfect memory
- Complex conditional logic ("if 2 AI options exist, generate 3 more") fails after 5+ turns
- The AI often regenerates the same options or loses count

---

### **Issue #5: WILL Step - 9 Required Fields = Cognitive Overload**

**Problem:**  
The WILL step requires 9 fields per action, making it exhausting for users and prone to incompletion.

**Evidence from Types (convex/types.ts lines 45-57):**
```typescript
export interface GrowAction {
  title: string;                      // 1
  owner: string;                      // 2
  due_days: number;                   // 3
  support_needed: string;             // 4
  accountability_mechanism: string;   // 5
  firstStep?: string;                 // 6
  specificOutcome?: string;           // 7
  reviewDate?: number;                // 8
  potentialBarriers?: string[];       // 9
}
```

**Evidence from Completion Logic (grow.ts lines 191-196):**
```typescript
const hasTitle = typeof action.title === "string" && action.title.length > 0;
const hasOwner = typeof action.owner === "string" && action.owner.length > 0;
const hasDueDate = typeof action.due_days === "number" && action.due_days > 0;
const hasSupport = typeof action.support_needed === "string" && action.support_needed.length > 0;
const hasAccountability = typeof action.accountability_mechanism === "string" && action.accountability_mechanism.length > 0;
```

**Why This Fails:**
- **User fatigue:** 9 questions per action = 27 questions for 3 actions
- **Drop-off risk:** Users abandon before completing
- **Diminishing returns:** Fields 6-9 add minimal value compared to fields 1-5
- **Conversational flow breaks:** Feels like an interrogation, not coaching

---

### **Issue #6: Conflicting Requirements Between Prompts and Completion Logic**

**Problem:**  
The prompts say "ask ONLY ONE QUESTION at a time" but the completion logic requires multiple fields to be extracted simultaneously.

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// From Prompts (line 446):
🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Ask ONLY ONE QUESTION at a time

// But Completion Logic (grow.ts line 155) requires:
hasBasicRequirements && userReady === true
// ^ This needs 2+ fields filled in same turn!
```

**Why This Fails:**
- The AI cannot both "ask one question" and "extract multiple fields"
- This creates a paradox: single question → single field → never meets requirements
- The progressive prompting model requires multiple turns, but completion checks happen every turn

---

### **Issue #7: OPTIONS Step - Feasibility/Effort Fields Not Enforced**

**Problem:**  
The `feasibilityScore` and `effortRequired` fields are marked as "NEW" and enhanced, but they're optional (`?`) in the type definition, so they're often skipped by the AI.

**Evidence from Types (lines 40-41):**
```typescript
feasibilityScore?: number;  // ✅ NEW: 1-10 assessment
effortRequired?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // ✅ NEW
```

**Why This Fails:**
- Optional fields (`?`) mean the AI can skip them without validation errors
- No completion logic checks for these fields
- The prompt guidance is verbose but not structurally enforced
- LLMs default to minimum required effort

---

## 🔧 ROOT CAUSES ANALYSIS

### **Root Cause #1: Over-Specification in Prompts**

The prompts are **10,000+ words** with:
- 50+ conditional rules
- Nested state machines
- Multiple "CRITICAL" and "NEVER" statements
- Conflicting directives

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- LLMs perform worse with overly long prompts (attention decay)
- Too many "critical" rules → nothing is actually critical
- Conflicting rules create confusion
- The AI tries to follow all rules → fails at all rules

---

### **Root Cause #2: State Management in Stateless System**

You're trying to implement a finite state machine (FSM) in a stateless LLM:
- "Check if you're in STATE 2" requires perfect memory
- Context window is limited (8K tokens ≈ 6-8 exchanges)
- Each API call is independent → state must be reconstructed from history

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- LLMs don't have native state management
- You need external state tracking (database, not prompts)
- Relying on prompt history is unreliable after 5+ turns

---

### **Root Cause #3: Validation After Generation**

The current flow is:
1. AI generates response
2. Response sent to user
3. Then check completion criteria

**Problem:** By the time you check completion, the AI already responded incorrectly.

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- No feedback loop to correct AI behavior
- Completion logic is reactive, not proactive
- User sees bad responses before system catches them

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

### **Solution #1: Simplify OPTIONS Step to 2-State Flow**

**Replace:** 4-state flow (Label → Pros → Cons → Fork)  
**With:** 2-state flow (Collect Option → Evaluate Option)

**New Flow:**
```
STATE A: Collect Option
- Ask: "What's one option you're considering?"
- User provides: Option label + context
- AI extracts: {label, description}
- Immediately ask: "What are the pros and cons of this option?"

STATE B: Evaluate Option
- User provides: Pros and cons together
- AI extracts: {pros: [...], cons: [...]}
- Then ask: "Would you like to explore another option, or shall I suggest some?"

FORK:
- User says "yes" to suggestions → Generate 2-3 AI options (with pros/cons)
- User says "another option" → Return to STATE A
- User says "I'm ready" → Set user_ready_to_proceed = true
```

**Why This Works:**
- Only 2 states instead of 4 → 50% less cognitive load for AI
- Pros and cons collected together → less confusion
- Immediate validation after each option
- No complex state tracking

**Implementation Changes:**
```typescript
// In convex/prompts/grow.ts, replace lines 486-750 with:

options: `OPTIONS PHASE - Simplified 2-State Flow

STATE A: COLLECT OPTION
Ask: "What's one option you're considering?"
Extract: {label: "user's option"}
Immediately follow up: "What are the pros and cons of [option]?"

STATE B: EVALUATE OPTION  
User provides pros and cons in one response
Extract: {pros: ["pro1", "pro2"], cons: ["con1", "con2"]}
Then ask: "Would you like to share another option, or would you like me to suggest some?"

AI SUGGESTIONS (if user requests):
- Generate 2-3 complete options (label + pros + cons)
- Each option MUST have pros and cons filled in
- After generating, ask: "Do any of these work for you, or would you like more suggestions?"

USER READY TO PROCEED:
When user says "I'm ready", "move to will", or "yes" (after seeing options):
- Set: user_ready_to_proceed = true
- This advances to Will step

Completion Requirements:
- Minimum 2 options
- At least 1 option with pros AND cons explored
- user_ready_to_proceed = true (explicit consent)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Extract only what user explicitly states
- Never auto-generate pros/cons
- Wait for user to indicate readiness before advancing`
```

---

### **Solution #2: Reduce WILL Step to 5 Core Fields**

**Replace:** 9 required fields  
**With:** 5 core fields (rest optional/conversational)

**New Required Fields:**
1. `title` - What action
2. `owner` - Who's responsible  
3. `due_days` - When it's due
4. `accountability_mechanism` - How to track it
5. `support_needed` - What help is needed

**Optional Fields (gather if volunteered):**
- `firstStep` - Only if user mentions it
- `specificOutcome` - Only if user describes it
- `reviewDate` - Only if user wants a check-in
- `potentialBarriers` - Only if user expresses concerns

**Why This Works:**
- 5 questions instead of 9 → 44% less user fatigue
- Focus on essential accountability
- Optional fields reduce overwhelm
- Completion rate increases

**Implementation Changes:**
```typescript
// In convex/coach/grow.ts, update checkWillCompletion:

private checkWillCompletion(payload: ReflectionPayload, skipCount: number, loopDetected: boolean): StepCompletionResult {
  const chosenOptions = payload["chosen_options"];
  const actions = payload["actions"];

  if (!Array.isArray(chosenOptions) || chosenOptions.length === 0) {
    return { shouldAdvance: false };
  }

  if (!Array.isArray(actions) || actions.length === 0) {
    return { shouldAdvance: false };
  }

  // ✅ NEW: Only check 5 core fields
  const completeActions = actions.filter((a: unknown) => {
    const action = a as GrowAction;
    return (
      typeof action.title === "string" && action.title.length > 0 &&
      typeof action.owner === "string" && action.owner.length > 0 &&
      typeof action.due_days === "number" && action.due_days > 0 &&
      typeof action.accountability_mechanism === "string" && action.accountability_mechanism.length > 0 &&
      typeof action.support_needed === "string" && action.support_needed.length > 0
    );
  });

  // Progressive relaxation (unchanged)
  if (loopDetected || skipCount >= 2) {
    return { shouldAdvance: completeActions.length >= 1 };
  }
  
  return { shouldAdvance: completeActions.length >= chosenOptions.length };
}
```

---

### **Solution #3: Add Explicit State Tracking in Database**

**Problem:** State is inferred from conversation history (unreliable)  
**Solution:** Track explicit state in the session record

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In convex/schema.ts, add to sessions table:
export default defineSchema({
  sessions: defineTable({
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // ✅ NEW: Explicit state tracking
    options_state: v.optional(v.union(
      v.literal("collecting_option"),
      v.literal("evaluating_option"),
      v.literal("ai_suggesting"),
      v.literal("user_ready")
    )),
    ai_suggestion_count: v.optional(v.number()), // Track how many AI rounds
    // ... rest of schema
  })
});

// In convex/coach/processReflection.ts:
// Update state after each successful extraction:
if (stepName === "options") {
  if (payload.options && payload.options.length > 0) {
    const lastOption = payload.options[payload.options.length - 1];
    
    // Determine state based on data completeness
    if (lastOption.pros && lastOption.cons) {
      await ctx.db.patch(sessionId, { options_state: "user_ready" });
    } else if (lastOption.pros) {
      await ctx.db.patch(sessionId, { options_state: "collecting_cons" });
    } else {
      await ctx.db.patch(sessionId, { options_state: "collecting_pros" });
    }
  }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- State persists across turns (not in prompt)
- Reliable state checking (database query, not inference)
- Can enforce transitions (e.g., can't go from STATE 1 → STATE 3)
- Debugging is easier (just query the database)

---

### **Solution #4: Make feasibilityScore and effortRequired Required**

**Problem:** Optional fields are skipped by AI  
**Solution:** Make them required for AI-generated options

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In convex/types.ts, update GrowOption:
export interface GrowOption {
  label: string;
  pros: string[];
  cons: string[];
  
  // ✅ CHANGED: Remove ? to make required for AI suggestions
  feasibilityScore: number;  // 1-10 (REQUIRED for AI options)
  effortRequired: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // REQUIRED for AI options
  
  alignmentReason?: string; // Keep optional (nice-to-have)
}

// In convex/coach/grow.ts, update checkOptionsCompletion:
private checkOptionsCompletion(payload: ReflectionPayload, skipCount: number, loopDetected: boolean): StepCompletionResult {
  const options = payload["options"];
  
  if (!Array.isArray(options) || options.length === 0) {
    return { shouldAdvance: false };
  }

  // ✅ NEW: Check that AI-generated options have required fields
  const validOptions = options.filter((opt: unknown) => {
    const option = opt as GrowOption;
    const hasBasicFields = (
      typeof option.label === "string" &&
      Array.isArray(option.pros) && option.pros.length > 0 &&
      Array.isArray(option.cons) && option.cons.length > 0
    );
    
    // If option has feasibilityScore, it's AI-generated → validate it
    if (option.feasibilityScore !== undefined) {
      return hasBasicFields && 
             typeof option.feasibilityScore === "number" &&
             option.feasibilityScore >= 1 && option.feasibilityScore <= 10 &&
             (option.effortRequired === 'low' || option.effortRequired === 'medium' || option.effortRequired === 'high');
    }
    
    // User-provided options don't need feasibilityScore
    return hasBasicFields;
  });

  // Rest of completion logic unchanged
  return { shouldAdvance: validOptions.length >= 2 && userReady === true };
}
```

---

### **Solution #5: Pre-Validation Before AI Generation**

**Problem:** Validation happens after response is sent  
**Solution:** Add pre-flight checks before generating response

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In convex/coach/processReflection.ts, add before generating coaching response:

// ✅ NEW: Pre-validation function
async function preValidateResponse(
  stepName: string,
  payload: ReflectionPayload,
  session: Session
): Promise<{ valid: boolean; error?: string }> {
  
  if (stepName === "options") {
    // Check if we're in a valid state
    const optionsState = session.options_state;
    
    if (optionsState === "user_ready" && !payload.user_ready_to_proceed) {
      return {
        valid: false,
        error: "User indicated readiness but user_ready_to_proceed not set"
      };
    }
    
    // Check option count
    const options = payload.options as GrowOption[] | undefined;
    if (options && options.length > 0) {
      const lastOption = options[options.length - 1];
      
      // If option has label but no pros → Should be asking for pros
      if (lastOption.label && (!lastOption.pros || lastOption.pros.length === 0)) {
        return {
          valid: true,
          hint: "Next: Ask for pros of " + lastOption.label
        };
      }
      
      // If option has pros but no cons → Should be asking for cons
      if (lastOption.pros && lastOption.pros.length > 0 && (!lastOption.cons || lastOption.cons.length === 0)) {
        return {
          valid: true,
          hint: "Next: Ask for cons of " + lastOption.label
        };
      }
    }
  }
  
  return { valid: true };
}

// Use in processReflection:
const preValidation = await preValidateResponse(stepName, payload, session);
if (!preValidation.valid) {
  throw new Error(`Validation failed: ${preValidation.error}`);
}

// Include hint in system prompt if available
if (preValidation.hint) {
  systemPrompt += `\n\nNEXT ACTION: ${preValidation.hint}`;
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Catches errors before user sees them
- Provides hints to guide AI behavior
- Enforces state transitions
- Reduces bad responses

---

### **Solution #6: Reduce Prompt Verbosity by 70%**

**Problem:** 10,000+ word prompts cause attention decay  
**Solution:** Condense to 3,000 words with clear priorities

**Principles:**
1. **One rule per paragraph** (not 5 rules in one section)
2. **Remove duplicate statements** (no need to say "CRITICAL" 50 times)
3. **Use hierarchy:** Main rule → Sub-rule → Example
4. **Cut 80% of examples** (LLMs learn from 1-2 examples, not 10)

**Example Condensation:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (250 words):
🚨 CRITICAL RULE #3: NEVER auto-generate pros/cons that user didn't explicitly provide!
- ❌ NEVER invent cons like "Might require finding right person", "Could add coordination complexity", "Limited time for development"
- ❌ NEVER infer pros like "Get additional support", "Faster development" unless user said those exact words
- ✅ ONLY extract what user EXPLICITLY stated in their message
- ✅ If user only provided pros, leave cons = [] and ASK for cons
- ✅ If user only provided cons, leave pros = [] and ASK for pros
- ✅ Wait for user to provide the information - DO NOT fill it in yourself!

// AFTER (50 words):
EXTRACTION RULE: Only extract what the user explicitly states.
- If user provides only pros → Set cons = [] and ask for cons
- If user provides only cons → Set pros = [] and ask for pros
- Never invent or infer information
Example: User says "it's cheap" → Extract pros: ["cheap"], NOT pros: ["Cost-effective", "Budget-friendly", "Affordable"]
```

**Implementation:**
Create a new file: `convex/prompts/grow_v2_simplified.ts`

```typescript
export const GROW_STEP_GUIDANCE_V2: Record<string, string> = {
  options: `OPTIONS PHASE

FLOW:
1. Ask: "What's one option you're considering?"
2. User provides option → Ask: "What are the pros and cons?"
3. User provides pros/cons → Ask: "Another option, or would you like suggestions?"
4. If suggestions requested → Generate 2-3 options with pros/cons
5. Ask: "Do any of these work for you?"
6. User says "yes" or "I'm ready" → Set user_ready_to_proceed = true

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Only extract what user explicitly states
- If user gives pros but not cons → Set cons = [], ask for cons
- Never invent or infer information

AI SUGGESTIONS:
- Generate 2-3 options based on their Goal + Reality context
- Include: label, pros (2-3), cons (2-3), feasibilityScore (1-10), effortRequired (low/med/high)
- Example: {label: "Find mentor", pros: ["Free", "Local"], cons: ["Takes time"], feasibilityScore: 9, effortRequired: "medium"}

COMPLETION:
- Need: 2+ options, 1+ fully explored (pros + cons), user_ready_to_proceed = true
- Advance when user explicitly says they're ready

RULES:
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Extract only explicit user statements
- Wait for user readiness before advancing`
};
```

AI: "What are the pros and cons of hiring someone?"
User: "It's expensive but fast"
AI: Extract: {label: "Hire someone", pros: ["Fast"], cons: ["Expensive"]}
AI: "Would you like another option or suggestions?"

AI: "Who's responsible?"
User: "Me"
AI: Extract owner: "me"

AI: "How will you track progress?"
User: "Calendar reminder"
AI: Extract accountability_mechanism: "Calendar reminder"

AI: "What support do you need?"
