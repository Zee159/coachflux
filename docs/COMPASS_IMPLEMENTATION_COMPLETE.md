# COMPASS Enhanced Implementation - Complete ‚úÖ

## Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**File Updated**: `convex/prompts/compass.ts`  
**Total Changes**: Enhanced all 4 COMPASS stages with GROW-style step-by-step questioning

---

## What Was Implemented

### üéØ All 4 COMPASS Stages Enhanced

1. **CLARITY Stage** (5 min) ‚úÖ
2. **OWNERSHIP Stage** (8 min) ‚úÖ  
3. **MAPPING Stage** (4 min) ‚úÖ
4. **PRACTICE Stage** (3 min) ‚úÖ

**Total Session Target**: ~20 minutes

---

## Key Enhancements Applied to Each Stage

### 1. Context Extraction Rules ‚úÖ

**Added to every stage:**

```typescript
üìã CONTEXT EXTRACTION FROM CONVERSATION HISTORY (CHECK FIRST)
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE asking ANY question, check conversation history for these fields:

‚úÖ IF user ALREADY stated [field]:
   ‚Üí Extract: [field]
   ‚Üí Acknowledge: "You mentioned..."
   ‚Üí Move DIRECTLY to next question (DO NOT re-ask)

‚ö†Ô∏è GOLDEN RULE: NEVER ask the same question twice.
```

**Impact**: Eliminates repetitive questioning, users don't repeat themselves

---

### 2. Explicit Question Sequencing ‚úÖ

**Added to every stage:**

```typescript
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ QUESTION 1: [Question Name] (MANDATORY)            ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [Purpose and importance]                           ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

Ask: "[Exact question]"

EXTRACTION RULES:
‚Üí Extract: [field_name]
‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è WAIT for user response
‚Üí DO NOT move to Question 2 until [condition]
‚Üí DO NOT [common mistake]

CONDITIONAL RESPONSE:
‚îå‚îÄ IF [condition]:
‚îÇ  ‚Üí [Action]
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Move to Question X
‚îî‚îÄ
```

**Impact**: AI knows exactly what to ask and when, reducing ambiguity

---

### 3. Conditional Logic & Branching ‚úÖ

**Examples added:**

**CLARITY:**
- IF description is vague ‚Üí Push for specificity
- IF user already shows understanding ‚Üí Skip Question 2

**OWNERSHIP:**
- IF initial_confidence >= 7 ‚Üí SKIP fear exploration, move to benefits
- IF initial_confidence <= 3 ‚Üí Use extra empathy, catastrophe_reality_check nudge
- IF user catastrophizes ‚Üí Use nudge immediately

**MAPPING:**
- IF action is vague ‚Üí Push for concrete action
- IF action is too big ‚Üí Reduce scope
- IF timing is vague ‚Üí Push for specific day/time

**PRACTICE:**
- IF action_commitment < 8 ‚Üí Boost to 10/10
- IF total_increase >= 3 ‚Üí CELEBRATE strongly
- IF total_increase 0 ‚Üí Investigate (coaching failure indicator)

**Impact**: AI adapts to context instead of robotic questioning

---

### 4. WAIT Instructions ‚úÖ

**Added throughout all stages:**

```typescript
‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è WAIT for user response
‚Üí DO NOT move to next question until you have [field]
‚Üí DO NOT guess or auto-fill
```

**Impact**: Forces sequential flow, prevents AI from rushing ahead

---

### 5. Validation Loops ‚úÖ

**Examples added:**

**OWNERSHIP:**
- IF user gives organizational benefit ‚Üí PUSH BACK: "That's for the organization. What's in it for YOU?"
- IF AI suggests benefits ‚Üí WAIT for user validation, DO NOT auto-fill

**MAPPING:**
- IF action is vague ‚Üí PUSH for specificity until concrete
- IF timing is vague ‚Üí DO NOT advance until day AND time

**PRACTICE:**
- IF commitment < 8 ‚Üí Boost before moving forward

**Impact**: Ensures quality responses before progressing

---

### 6. Completion Checklists ‚úÖ

**Added to every stage:**

```typescript
‚úÖ STAGE COMPLETION CHECKLIST
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

Before advancing to [NEXT STAGE], verify:

MANDATORY (Must Have):
‚úÖ [field_1] - [description] (CRITICAL)
‚úÖ [field_2] - [description] (CRITICAL)

IF ANY MANDATORY FIELD MISSING:
‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT advance
‚Üí Go back and complete it
‚Üí Only advance when complete
```

**Impact**: AI verifies completion before advancing, prevents incomplete stages

---

### 7. AI Nudge Integration ‚úÖ

**Preserved all existing nudges, added explicit triggers:**

```typescript
üîß AI NUDGES - WHEN TO USE

[nudge_name] (Question X):
TRIGGER: [Specific condition]
USE: "[Exact nudge text]"
```

**CLARITY Nudges:**
- specificity_push
- control_clarification

**OWNERSHIP Nudges:**
- catastrophe_reality_check
- past_success_mining
- evidence_confrontation
- resistance_cost
- threat_to_opportunity
- story_challenge

**MAPPING Nudges:**

- concretize_action
- build_in_backup
- perfect_to_progress

**PRACTICE Nudges:**
- lower_the_bar
- future_self_anchor
- reflect_breakthrough
- confidence_progress_highlight

**Impact**: AI knows exactly when and how to use each nudge

---

### 8. Success Metrics & Targets ‚úÖ

**Added to every stage:**

```typescript
üìä SUCCESS METRICS

TARGET OUTCOMES:
‚úÖ [Specific measurable outcome]
‚úÖ [Another outcome]

STAGE SUCCESSFUL IF:

## Examples of Enhanced Interactions

### Before (Current COMPASS - Repetitive)

```
AI: "How confident do you feel about this change?"
User: "About a 3. I'm not good at tech."
AI: "What's making you feel unconfident?"
User: "I just said - I'm not good at tech."
AI: "What personal benefits might you gain?"
User: "I don't know."
AI: "What if you could build new skills?"
User: "Maybe."
‚Üí Repetitive, no transformation
```

### After (Enhanced COMPASS - Context-Aware)

```
AI: "On 1-10, how confident do you feel about this change?"
User: "About a 3. I'm not good at tech."
[Extracts: initial_confidence: 3, limiting_belief: "not good at tech"]

AI: "That's a tough place to start. What's the worst that could realistically happen?"
[Uses catastrophe_reality_check nudge immediately]
User: "I guess... I'd be slower at first. Need to ask for help."

AI: "So even worst-case, you'd handle it by asking for help. What could you gain personally?"
User: "I don't see any benefit."

AI: "Some leaders have found: Could this build career-advancing skills? Might you become a valuable expert?"
[Offers AI suggestions, waits for validation]
User: "The expert thing. I did that with Slack actually."

AI: "You became a Slack expert! You called yourself 'not good at tech' but you're the Slack expert. What if that story isn't accurate?"
[Uses evidence_confrontation with their own past success]
User: "Huh. I guess I CAN learn tech. I just need time."

AI: "Exactly. Where's your confidence now, 1-10?"
User: "Maybe 6. I'm not scared anymore."
[Calculates: +3 point increase, SUCCESS]

AI: "That's a +3 point increase! You've had a real shift. Ready to identify your action?"
‚Üí Clear transformation, context-aware, no repetition
```

## Testing & Validation

### Recommended Testing Approach

1. **Functional Testing** (5-10 sessions)
   - [ ] Test CLARITY with vague input ‚Üí Pushes for specificity
   - [ ] Test OWNERSHIP with low confidence ‚Üí Uses appropriate nudges
   - [ ] Test OWNERSHIP with limiting belief ‚Üí Challenges with evidence
   - [ ] Test MAPPING with vague action ‚Üí Pushes for concrete action
   - [ ] Test PRACTICE with low commitment ‚Üí Boosts to 10/10

2. **Edge Case Testing** (5-10 sessions)
   - [ ] User already mentioned information ‚Üí Context extraction works
   - [ ] User gives organizational benefit ‚Üí Push back works
   - [ ] User can't find past success ‚Üí Mining prompts work
   - [ ] User says "I can't control anything" ‚Üí Reframe works
   - [ ] Confidence doesn't increase ‚Üí Handling works

3. **Metrics Tracking** (20+ sessions)
   - [ ] Average confidence increase (target: +3 points)
   - [ ] Re-asking rate (should be < 10%)
   - [ ] Stage completion rate (should be >= 90%)
   - [ ] Session duration (should stay ~20 min)
   - [ ] User satisfaction

---

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative (After 20+ sessions)

- [ ] **Confidence Increase**: >= +3 points (80% of sessions)
- [ ] **Re-asking Rate**: < 10% (down from ~30%)
- [ ] **Stage Completion**: >= 90% complete all stages
- [ ] **Session Duration**: ~20 minutes average
- [ ] **Action Commitment**: >= 8/10 (80% of sessions)

### Qualitative

- [ ] Users report "AI understood me better"
- [ ] Fewer "AI keeps asking same thing" complaints
- [ ] Smoother transitions between stages
- [ ] Clearer coaching progression
- [ ] Higher user satisfaction scores

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Prompts Too Long
**Status**: ‚úÖ Mitigated
- Prompts are detailed but structured
- Similar length to working GROW prompts
- Clear sections with visual separators

### Risk 2: Too Rigid/Prescriptive
**Status**: ‚úÖ Mitigated
- Conditional logic preserves flexibility
- "Consider" language where appropriate
- AI can adapt based on context

### Risk 3: Breaks Existing Behavior
**Status**: ‚úÖ Mitigated
- Prompt-only changes (no code changes)
- Can rollback immediately if issues
- Backward compatible with existing data

### Risk 4: Token Usage Increase
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor Required
- Longer prompts = more tokens
- Need to monitor costs
- May optimize after testing
