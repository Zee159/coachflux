# Framework Introduction Phase Implementation

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

## üéØ Overview

Added an **Introduction Phase** to both GROW and COMPASS frameworks to:
1. Welcome users warmly
2. Explain what the framework is and how it works
3. Describe ideal use cases and scenarios
4. Get explicit user consent before starting the session

This ensures users understand what they're signing up for and prevents mismatched expectations.

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### **For Both Frameworks:**
1. ‚úÖ New "introduction" step added as step 0 (before existing steps)
2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive introduction prompts with framework explanation
3. ‚úÖ User consent detection (`user_consent_given` boolean field)
4. ‚úÖ Completion logic that requires explicit consent
5. ‚úÖ Transition messages when consent is given
6. ‚úÖ Alternative framework suggestions when appropriate

---

## üé® GROW Introduction

### **Welcome Message Structure:**

```
1. WARM GREETING
"Welcome! I'm here to help you think through your goals and challenges."

2. FRAMEWORK EXPLANATION
"We'll be using the GROW method - a proven coaching approach that helps you move from where you are now to where you want to be. GROW stands for Goal, Reality, Options, and Will."

3. HOW IT WORKS (15-20 minutes)
‚Ä¢ Goal: Define what you want to achieve and why it matters
‚Ä¢ Reality: Understand your current situation and what's in your way
‚Ä¢ Options: Explore different approaches you could take
‚Ä¢ Will: Create a concrete action plan with specific steps

4. IDEAL USE CASES
‚Ä¢ Setting and achieving specific goals (career, personal, business)
‚Ä¢ Making important decisions when you have multiple options
‚Ä¢ Breaking through obstacles or stuck situations
‚Ä¢ Creating action plans for projects or changes
‚Ä¢ Improving skills or performance in a specific area

5. SCENARIO EXAMPLES
‚Ä¢ "I want to transition to a new role but don't know where to start"
‚Ä¢ "I need to launch my business by next quarter"
‚Ä¢ "I'm stuck on a project and need to figure out next steps"
‚Ä¢ "I want to improve my leadership skills"
‚Ä¢ "I need to make a decision about my career direction"

6. WHAT TO EXPECT
"I'll ask you questions to help you think deeply, and together we'll build a clear plan. You'll leave with specific actions you can take right away."

7. ASK FOR CONSENT
"Does this framework feel right for what you want to work on today?"
```

### **Handling User Response:**

| User Says | Coach Response | System Action |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| ‚úÖ "Yes" / "Sure" / "Let's do it" | "Great! Let's begin. What goal or challenge would you like to work on today?" | Advance to Goal phase |
| ‚ùå "No" / "Not sure" | "No problem! What brought you here today? Maybe I can suggest a different approach that fits better." | Pause session, offer alternatives |
| ‚ùì Asks questions | Answer clearly, then ask again: "Now that you know more, does this feel like the right approach for you?" | Stay in introduction |

## üß≠ COMPASS Introduction

### **Welcome Message Structure:**

```
1. WARM GREETING
"Welcome! I'm here to help you navigate change with confidence."

2. FRAMEWORK EXPLANATION
"We'll be using the COMPASS method - a coaching approach specifically designed for workplace change. COMPASS helps you transform from feeling uncertain or resistant about a change to feeling confident and in control."

3. HOW IT WORKS (15-20 minutes)
‚Ä¢ Clarity: Understand exactly what's changing and what you can control
‚Ä¢ Ownership: Build confidence by recognizing your strengths and potential benefits
‚Ä¢ Mapping: Create one specific action you'll take this week
‚Ä¢ Practice: Commit to your action with a clear plan

4. IDEAL USE CASES (WORKPLACE CHANGE SPECIFIC)
‚Ä¢ Company reorganizations or restructuring
‚Ä¢ New processes, tools, or ways of working
‚Ä¢ Leadership changes or team transitions
‚Ä¢ Role changes or new responsibilities
‚Ä¢ Adapting to industry shifts or market changes
‚Ä¢ Navigating organizational transformation

5. SCENARIO EXAMPLES
‚Ä¢ "My company is restructuring and I don't know where I fit"
‚Ä¢ "We're moving to a new system and I'm worried I won't adapt"
‚Ä¢ "My manager changed and the new one has a different style"
‚Ä¢ "My role is shifting and I'm unsure about new expectations"
‚Ä¢ "Our team is merging with another and I feel anxious"

6. WHAT TO EXPECT
"We'll help you move from feeling uncertain to confident. You'll identify one specific action you can take this week to build momentum. Most people see their confidence increase significantly by the end of our session."

7. WHEN COMPASS ISN'T THE RIGHT FIT
"Note: COMPASS is designed for workplace change. If you're working on a personal goal, decision-making, or project planning (not change-related), the GROW method might be a better fit."

8. ASK FOR CONSENT
"Does this framework feel right for what you're facing today?"
```

### **Handling User Response:**

| User Says | Coach Response | System Action |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| ‚úÖ "Yes" / "Absolutely" / "That's exactly what I need" | "Excellent! Let's begin. On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel about the change you're facing right now?" | Advance to Clarity phase |
| ‚ùå "No" / "This is more about a goal" | "Thanks for letting me know! It sounds like the GROW method might be a better fit. Would you like to try GROW instead?" | Suggest framework switch |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è "It's personal change" (not workplace) | "COMPASS is optimized for workplace change, but principles can apply. Continue with COMPASS, or try GROW for personal goals?" | User chooses framework |
| ‚ùì Asks questions | Answer clearly, then ask again | Stay in introduction |

## üîÑ Session Flow

### **Before (Old Flow):**
```
Session Start ‚Üí Goal ‚Üí Reality ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Will ‚Üí Review ‚Üí End
```

### **After (New Flow):**
```
Session Start ‚Üí Introduction ‚Üí [User Consent] ‚Üí Goal ‚Üí Reality ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Will ‚Üí Review ‚Üí End
                              ‚Üì
                        [If No Consent]
                              ‚Üì
                    Suggest Alternative Framework / Pause
```

---

## ‚úÖ User Consent Detection

### **How It Works:**

```typescript
// In introduction step, coach extracts:
{
  "user_consent_given": true,  // or false
  "coach_reflection": "Welcome! ... Does this framework feel right for you?"
}

// Completion logic checks:
private checkIntroductionCompletion(payload: ReflectionPayload): StepCompletionResult {
  const userConsentGiven = payload["user_consent_given"];
  
  if (typeof userConsentGiven === "boolean" && userConsentGiven === true) {
    return { shouldAdvance: true };  // ‚úÖ Proceed to next step
  }
  
  return { shouldAdvance: false };  // ‚ùå Stay in introduction
}
```

### **Consent Phrases (AI Detects):**

**YES (proceed):**
- "yes", "sure", "sounds good", "let's do it", "that works", "perfect", "okay"
- "absolutely", "that's exactly what I need"

**NO (pause/suggest alternative):**
- "no", "not sure", "maybe not", "I don't think so", "doesn't feel right"
- "this is more about a goal", "I'm not dealing with change"

---

## üéØ Key Features

### **1. Framework Differentiation**
- **GROW:** Emphasizes it's for "goals, decisions, action plans"
- **COMPASS:** Emphasizes it's for "workplace change" specifically
- Cross-references: COMPASS suggests GROW if not change-related

### **2. Scenario Examples**
- Concrete examples help users self-assess fit
- GROW: 5 diverse scenarios (career, business, projects, skills)
- COMPASS: 5 workplace change scenarios (restructuring, new systems, leadership changes)

### **3. Expectation Setting**
- Duration: "15-20 minutes"
- Process: Step-by-step overview
- Outcome: Clear deliverable (action plan for GROW, confidence boost + 1 action for COMPASS)

### **4. Warm & Professional Tone**
- Empathetic language
- Non-judgmental
- User-centered ("I'm here to help YOU")
- Conversational, not robotic

---

## üìä Expected Impact

### **Quantitative Benefits:**
- **Reduced dropouts:** Users know what to expect
- **Better framework fit:** Users select appropriate framework
- **Increased completion:** Aligned expectations = higher engagement
- **Framework switching:** Users can pivot if mismatched

### **Qualitative Benefits:**
- **Trust building:** Professional intro builds rapport
- **Psychological safety:** Users feel in control
- **Clarity:** No surprises about what they're committing to
- **Empowerment:** Explicit consent gives users agency

---

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### **Test Case 1: GROW Acceptance**
```
Coach: [Introduction message] "Does this framework feel right for what you want to work on today?"
User: "Yes, sounds perfect"
Expected: user_consent_given = true, advance to Goal phase
```

### **Test Case 2: GROW Rejection**
```
Coach: [Introduction message]
User: "No, I'm not sure this is what I need"
Expected: user_consent_given = false, offer alternative, stay in introduction
```

### **Test Case 3: COMPASS ‚Üí GROW Switch**
```
Coach: [COMPASS introduction]
User: "Actually, this is more about setting a personal goal, not workplace change"
Expected: Suggest GROW framework, offer to switch
```

### **Test Case 4: Questions Before Consent**
```
Coach: [Introduction message]
User: "How long will this take?"
Expected: Answer question, ask consent again, stay in introduction
```

### **Test Case 5: COMPASS for Personal Change**
```
Coach: [COMPASS introduction]
User: "This is about a personal life change, not work"
Expected: Acknowledge, offer GROW as better fit or continue with COMPASS if user prefers
```

3. **Phase 3:** Monitor consent rates, completion rates, framework switching
4. **Phase 4:** Full rollout if metrics improve

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### **To Monitor:**
1. **Consent Rate:** % of users who say "yes" after introduction
2. **Framework Switch Rate:** % who switch frameworks after intro
3. **Completion Rate:** % who complete full session (should increase)
4. **Dropout Rate:** % who leave after introduction (should decrease)
5. **User Satisfaction:** Feedback on introduction clarity

### **Target Metrics:**
- Consent Rate: ‚â• 85%
- Framework Switch Rate: 5-10% (healthy self-selection)
- Completion Rate: +15-20% improvement
- Dropout During Intro: < 10%

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

### **Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
1. Add framework selection UI (choose GROW vs COMPASS upfront)
2. Track consent reasons (why users say no)
3. A/B test different introduction lengths

### **Medium-term (1-3 months):**
1. Personalized introductions based on user profile
2. Video/visual introductions (not just text)
3. Framework recommendation engine (AI suggests best fit)
4. Multi-language introductions

### **Long-term (3-6 months):**
1. Dynamic framework switching mid-session (if user realizes mismatch)
2. Hybrid frameworks (combine GROW + COMPASS for complex scenarios)
3. Custom framework creation for enterprise clients
4. Framework effectiveness scoring (which works best for which scenarios)

---

## üéì Developer Notes

### **Data Storage:**
- `user_consent_given` is stored in `reflections.payload` (uses `v.any()`)
- No schema migration required
- Backward compatible: Old sessions without introduction still work
- Type-safe: Completion logic checks for boolean type

### **Extensibility:**
- Easy to add introduction step to new frameworks
- Template provided for creating new framework introductions
- Consent detection logic is framework-agnostic

### **Performance:**
- Introduction adds ~2 minutes to session duration
- Minimal overhead (one extra reflection in database)
- No additional LLM costs (same pattern as other steps)
