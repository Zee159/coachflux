## 🔄 INTEGRATION REQUIRED

### **High Priority: coach.ts Integration**

The `coach.ts` file needs significant updates to:

1. **Import new modules:**
```typescript
import { performSafetyCheck, getSessionDisclaimer } from './safety';
import { detectApplicableNudges, generateNudgePrompt } from './nudges';
import { compassFramework } from './frameworks/compass';
import { generateCompassReport } from './reports-new';
```

2. **Add safety monitoring to every user message:**
```typescript
// In sendMessage action/query
const safetyCheck = performSafetyCheck(userMessage, userCountryCode);

if (safetyCheck.shouldStop) {
  // End session immediately
  // Return safety response
  // Mark session as stopped for safety
}

if (safetyCheck.flagged) {
  // Log safety flag
  // Show safety response
  // Consider pausing session
}
```

3. **Integrate nudge detection:**
```typescript
// After user message in each stage
const currentStage = getCurrentStage(session);
const applicableNudges = detectApplicableNudges(userMessage, currentStage);

// Add to AI system prompt
const nudgeGuidance = generateNudgePrompt(currentStage, applicableNudges);
```

4. **Track confidence throughout session:**
```typescript
// Initialize at session start
const confidenceTracking = {
  initial_confidence: 0,
  post_ownership_confidence: 0,
  final_confidence: 0,
  confidence_change: 0,
  confidence_percent_increase: 0
};

// Update after each relevant stage
// Calculate changes in real-time
```

5. **Use new framework structure:**
```typescript
// Replace 6-stage with 4-stage flow
const framework = compassFramework;
// Update step progression: clarity → ownership → mapping → practice
```

6. **Generate new report format:**
```typescript
// At session completion
const report = generateCompassReport(sessionData);
// Store and display 11-section report
```

### **Medium Priority: Frontend Updates**

Frontend components need updates to support:

1. **Session Disclaimer Display:**
   - Show `getSessionDisclaimer()` before session start
   - Require "CONTINUE" acknowledgment
   - "CRISIS" button for immediate resources

2. **Real-time Confidence Tracking:**
   - Display confidence meter (1-10 scale)
   - Show confidence change as it happens
   - Celebrate increases visually

3. **Safety Alert UI:**
   - Show safety responses prominently
   - Breathing exercise timer/guide
   - Emergency contact information display
   - Session pause/end notifications

4. **New Report Display:**
   - 11-section formatted report
   - Visual confidence journey chart
   - Collapsible sections
   - Progress tracking dashboard
   - Printable/downloadable format

5. **Action Commitment UI:**
   - Calendar integration prompt
   - Commitment confidence meter
   - Support person contact capture

**vs. Traditional Coaching:**
- ✅ 24/7 availability vs. scheduled appointments
- ✅ $X per session vs. $150-300/hour
- ✅ 20 minutes vs. 45-60 minutes
- ✅ Consistent COMPASS method vs. variable approaches

**vs. Therapy Apps:**
- ✅ Workplace change focus vs. mental health treatment
- ✅ Action-oriented vs. emotional processing
- ✅ 20 minutes vs. 45+ minutes
- ✅ Confidence building vs. diagnosis/treatment

**vs. Change Management Tools:**
- ✅ For individuals vs. organizations
- ✅ Personal confidence vs. project management

## 🔐 SAFETY & COMPLIANCE

### Legal Disclaimers Implemented:
- ✅ Pre-session disclaimer with acknowledgment
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries (NOT therapy/medical/legal advice)
- ✅ Crisis resource provision (5 levels)
- ✅ Automatic session termination for crisis indicators

### Data Privacy:
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Ensure safety flags logged but user messages not stored unnecessarily
- ⚠️ **TODO:** GDPR compliance for international users
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Anonymized analytics only

### Ethical Coaching:
- ✅ No prescriptive advice - facilitative only
- ✅ User owns all insights and decisions
- ✅ AI never invents benefits/actions without user validation
- ✅ Challenge limiting beliefs with evidence, not judgment

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests Needed:
```typescript
// Safety system
test('detectSafetyLevel - crisis keywords trigger crisis level')
test('generateSafetyResponse - returns correct resources per country')
test('shouldStopSession - returns true for crisis/severe only')

// Nudge system
test('detectApplicableNudges - returns correct nudges for message')
test('getNudgeTemplate - returns valid template string')
test('generateNudgePrompt - formats nudges for AI correctly')

// Framework
test('compassFramework - has 4 stages with correct structure')
test('compassFramework - completion rules validate required fields')

// Reporting
test('generateCompassReport - produces 11 sections')
test('generateCompassReport - calculates confidence change correctly')
```

### Integration Tests Needed:
```typescript
test('Full COMPASS session - clarity to practice with safety checks')
test('Safety trigger mid-session - appropriate response and pause')
test('Confidence tracking - updates correctly through stages')
test('Nudge application - triggered by user message, added to prompt')
test('Report generation - complete session data produces valid report')
```

### E2E Tests Needed:
```typescript
test('Complete happy path - user completes 4-stage session')
test('Safety crisis - session terminates with resources shown')
test('Low confidence start - reaches 6+/10 by end')
test('Vague action - pushed to specificity via nudges')
test('Report download - all 11 sections rendered')
```

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

### Removed (Old 6-Stage Model):
- ❌ `anchoring` stage (merged into mapping + practice)
- ❌ `sustaining` stage (not needed for individual sessions)
- ❌ `review` stage (replaced by practice)
- ❌ Success vision tracking (simplified)
- ❌ Stakeholder mapping (supporters/resistors - too org-focused)

### Changed:
- 🔄 `clarity` - Added sphere_of_control focus
- 🔄 `ownership` - Now PRIMARY confidence building stage (8 min)
- 🔄 `mapping` - Narrowed to ONE action only (was multiple)
- 🔄 `practice` - Renamed from old practice stage, different purpose

### Added:
- ✅ Safety monitoring (5 levels)
- ✅ Confidence tracking (1-10 scale, primary metric)
- ✅ AI nudge library (18 types)
- ✅ Geo-specific emergency resources
- ✅ 11-section comprehensive reporting
- ✅ Past success activation
- ✅ Limiting belief challenges
- ✅ Breakthrough moment capture

---

## 💡 KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### Why 4 Stages Instead of 6?
**Individual users don't need:**
- Anchoring (environment design) - Too complex for 20-min session
- Sustaining (team leadership) - They're not leading teams
- Separate Review - Integrated into Practice stage

**Focus on:**
- Confidence building (Ownership = 8 minutes, nearly half the session)
- ONE concrete action (not overwhelming action lists)
- Rapid transformation (20 minutes total)

### Why Confidence as Primary Metric?
**More measurable than:**
- "Emotional state" (subjective, hard to quantify)
- "Readiness score" (what does 3/5 mean?)
- "Commitment" (binary, less nuanced)

**Confidence 1-10:**
- Easy to understand and self-assess
- Shows progress clearly (+4 points is meaningful)
- Predicts action completion
- Comparable across sessions

### Why 18 Nudges?
**Balance between:**
- Too few: Coach feels repetitive, lacks nuance
- Too many: Overwhelming for AI to choose correctly

**18 nudges cover:**
- 6 categories of coaching interventions
- All 4 stages of COMPASS
- Common resistance patterns
- Evidence-based reframes

### Why 11 Report Sections?
**Comprehensive without overwhelming:**
- Sections 1-3: What happened (data)
- Sections 4-5: What it means (insights + strengths)
- Sections 6-8: What to watch (focus areas + pitfalls + opportunities)
- Sections 9-10: What to do (action plan + tracking)
- Section 11: Safety net (wellbeing resources)

---

## 🎓 TRAINING NEEDED

### For AI Coach (System Prompts):
1. How to detect safety triggers → Use safety response
2. When to apply each of 18 nudges → Pattern matching
3. How to build confidence systematically → Ownership stage flow
4. How to push for action specificity → Mapping stage flow
5. How to celebrate transformation → Practice stage flow

### For Users (Onboarding):
1. What COMPASS does (20-min confidence boost + action plan)
2. What COMPASS doesn't do (not therapy, not magic solution)
3. How to prepare (think about a specific change you're facing)
4. What to expect (4 stages, questions about your situation)
5. How to get most value (be honest, go deep, commit to action)
