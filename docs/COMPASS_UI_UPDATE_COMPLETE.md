## Changes Made

### 1. Updated COMPASS_STEPS Array ✅

**File**: `src/components/SessionView.tsx` (Line 595)

**Before:**
```typescript
const COMPASS_STEPS = ["clarity", "ownership", "mapping", "practice", "anchoring", "review"];
// 6 stages - OLD MODEL
```

**After:**
```typescript
const COMPASS_STEPS = ["clarity", "ownership", "mapping", "practice"];
// 4 stages - NEW MODEL
```

**Impact**: Sidebar now shows only 4 stages for COMPASS sessions

---

### 2. Updated Step Descriptions ✅

**File**: `src/components/SessionView.tsx` (Lines 199-202)

**Before:**
```typescript
clarity: "Understand what's changing and why it matters.",
ownership: "Build personal commitment to the change.",
mapping: "Create a specific action plan.",
practice: "Plan small experiments to build confidence.",
```

**After:**
```typescript
clarity: "Understand the change and identify what you can control.",
ownership: "Transform resistance into commitment. Build confidence.",
mapping: "Identify ONE specific action with day, time, and backup plan.",
practice: "Lock in 10/10 commitment and recognize your transformation.",
```

**Impact**: More accurate descriptions matching new prompts

---

### 3. Updated Step Labels ✅

**File**: `src/components/SessionView.tsx` (Lines 212-215)

**Before:**
```typescript
clarity: "🧭 CLARITY: What's changing and why?",
ownership: "💪 OWNERSHIP: Why does this matter to you?",
mapping: "🗺️ MAPPING: What's your action plan?",
practice: "🎯 PRACTICE: What small experiments will you try?",
```

**After:**
```typescript
clarity: "🧭 CLARITY: What's changing? What can you control?",
ownership: "💪 OWNERSHIP: Building your confidence and commitment",
mapping: "🗺️ MAPPING: Your specific action plan",
practice: "🎯 PRACTICE: Locking in your commitment",
```

**Impact**: Clearer labels reflecting new model's focus

---

### 4. Updated Step Tips ✅

**File**: `src/components/SessionView.tsx` (Lines 225-228)

**Before:**
```typescript
clarity: "Focus on understanding the change landscape - who supports it, who resists it.",
ownership: "Be honest about your feelings. Fear and excitement can coexist.",
mapping: "Break big changes into small, specific actions with clear timelines.",
practice: "Start tiny. Even 15 minutes counts. Build confidence through doing.",
```

**After:**
```typescript
clarity: "You can't control the change, but you CAN control your response and attitude.",
ownership: "Your confidence can increase 3-4 points in this stage. Let it happen.",
mapping: "Be specific: 'Thursday 2-4pm' not 'soon'. Small action beats big plan.",
practice: "You've had a transformation. Recognize it. Celebrate it.",
```

**Impact**: Tips now reflect new model's approach (sphere of control, confidence metrics, specificity)

---

### 5. Updated Coaching Questions ✅

**File**: `src/components/SessionView.tsx` (Lines 282-322)

#### CLARITY Questions:
**Before:**
```typescript
"What specific change is happening?",
"What problem is this trying to solve?",
"Who supports this change and why?",
"Who resists this change and why?",
"What happens if this change doesn't happen?"
```

**After:**
```typescript
"What specific change are you dealing with?",
"On a scale of 1-5, how well do you understand what's happening and why?",
"What's most confusing or unclear about this change?",
"What parts of this can you control vs. what's beyond your control?"
```

#### OWNERSHIP Questions:
**Before:**
```typescript
"How do you personally feel about this change?",
"What's in it for you if this succeeds?",
"What's at risk for you if this fails?",
"How does this align with your values?",
"What would make you more excited about this?"
```

**After:**
```typescript
"On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel about navigating this successfully?",
"What's making you feel unconfident or worried?",
"What's the cost if you stay stuck in resistance?",
"What could you gain personally if you adapt well to this?",
"Tell me about a time you successfully handled change before.",
"What strengths from that experience can you use now?",
"Where's your confidence now, 1-10?"
```

#### MAPPING Questions:
**Before:**
```typescript
"What are the first 3 things you need to do?",
"When will you do each of these?",
"What resources do you need?",
"Who else needs to be involved?",
"What could go wrong and how will you handle it?"
```

**After:**
```typescript
"Given what you've realized, what's ONE small action you could take this week?",
"What's the smallest possible step? What feels doable?",
"What specifically will you do, and when? (day, time, duration)",
"What might get in your way, and how will you handle that?",
"Who could support you with this?"
```

#### PRACTICE Questions:
**Before:**
```typescript
"What have you tried?",
"What worked better than expected?",
"What was harder than expected?",
"What did you learn?",
"What will you do differently next time?"
```

**After:**
```typescript
"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you'll do this?",
"What would make it a 10?",
"After you complete this action, what will you have proven to yourself?",
"When we started, confidence was [X]/10. Where is it now?",
"What's the one thing you're taking away from today?"
```

**Impact**: Questions now match the enhanced prompts exactly

### 6. Updated Report Icons ✅

**File**: `src/components/SessionReport.tsx` (Lines 345-348)

clarity: { label: "Clarity", icon: "C" },
ownership: { label: "Ownership", icon: "O" },
mapping: { label: "Mapping", icon: "M" },
practice: { label: "Practice", icon: "P" },
```

ownership: { label: "Ownership", icon: "💪" },
