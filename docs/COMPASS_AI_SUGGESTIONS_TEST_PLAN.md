# COMPASS AI Suggestions - Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan covers end-to-end testing of the AI suggestion feature for the COMPASS framework.

## Pre-Test Checklist

- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined in `convex/types.ts`
- [x] All 4 COMPASS phases updated with "THE FORK" pattern
- [x] `generateCOMPASSuggestions()` function implemented
- [x] `detectSuggestionChoice()` integrated into coach action
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] All code follows strict TypeScript standards (no `any` types)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. MAPPING Phase - AI Suggestions

**Setup**:
- Start COMPASS session
- Complete Clarity and Ownership phases
- Enter Mapping phase

**Test Steps**:
1. Provide 1-2 initial actions
2. Wait for "THE FORK" question: "Would you like to think through more actions yourself, OR..."
3. Respond with: "Please suggest some"
4. Verify AI generates 2-3 actions with timeline and resources
5. Verify validation question appears: "Do any of these fit your situation?"
6. Confirm suggestions are contextually relevant to change_description

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ AI suggestions based on Clarity phase context
- ✅ Each action has: action, timeline, resources_needed
- ✅ Suggestions are contextually relevant
- ✅ Validation question asked before advancing

### 2. MAPPING Phase - Self-Generated

**Test Steps**:
1. Provide 1-2 initial actions
2. Wait for "THE FORK" question
3. Respond with: "I'll think of more myself"
4. Verify coach continues facilitative questioning
5. Verify NO AI suggestions are generated

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Coach asks: "What else do you think you need to do?"
- ✅ No AI suggestions provided
- ✅ User maintains full agency

### 3. ANCHORING Phase - AI Suggestions

**Setup**:
- Complete Mapping and Practice phases
- Enter Anchoring phase

**Test Steps**:
1. Identify 1-2 environmental barriers
2. Provide 1-2 environmental changes
3. Wait for "THE FORK" question
4. Respond with: "Yes, please suggest"
5. Verify AI generates environment design strategies
6. Verify suggestions include: environmental_changes, habits_to_build, accountability_plan

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ AI suggestions based on Practice phase learnings
- ✅ Suggestions include habit stacking, cues/reminders, accountability
- ✅ Validation question asked

### 4. SUSTAINING Phase - AI Suggestions

**Test Steps**:
1. Provide initial leadership visibility actions
2. Mention 1-2 metrics
3. Wait for "THE FORK" question
4. Respond with: "What would you recommend?"
5. Verify AI generates leadership strategies
6. Verify suggestions include: metrics_tracking, team_support_plan, celebration_plan

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ AI suggestions based on previous phases
- ✅ Metrics include leading and lagging indicators
- ✅ Suggestions feel authentic to leadership context

### 5. OWNERSHIP Phase - AI Perspectives (Careful)

**Test Steps**:
1. Struggle to identify personal benefits (say "I don't know")
2. Wait for careful "THE FORK" question
3. Respond with: "Yes, help me see some perspectives"
4. Verify AI offers perspectives as QUESTIONS, not statements
5. Verify framing: "Some leaders have found... Do any resonate?"
6. Verify personal_benefits array is EMPTY until user confirms

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ AI offers perspectives, NOT prescriptions
- ✅ Framed as questions for validation
- ✅ personal_benefits array remains empty until user confirms
- ✅ No assumptions made about user's feelings

### 6. Detection Logic - Various Phrases

**Test AI Suggestion Detection**:
Test that these trigger AI suggestions:
- "suggest"
- "help me"
- "what do you think"
- "give me suggestions"
- "yes please"
- "okay"

**Test Self-Generation Detection**:
Test that these trigger facilitative coaching:
- "I have more"
- "let me think"
- "I'll share another"
- "I want to do this myself"
- "no thanks"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ `detectSuggestionChoice()` correctly identifies intent
- ✅ Appropriate path activated (PATH A or PATH B)

### 7. Context Extraction

**Test Context Flow**:
1. In Clarity, provide: change_description = "Moving to remote work"
2. In Ownership, provide: personal_benefits = ["Better work-life balance"]
3. In Mapping, request AI suggestions
4. Verify suggestions reference "remote work" and consider "work-life balance"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Context from earlier phases informs suggestions
- ✅ Suggestions are specific to user's situation
- ✅ Not generic, templated responses

### 8. Validation Required

**Test Validation Enforcement**:
1. Request AI suggestions in any phase
2. Receive AI suggestions
3. Verify coach ALWAYS asks validation question
4. Verify coach WAITS for response before advancing

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Validation question appears after every AI suggestion
- ✅ No automatic advancement
- ✅ User must confirm/modify suggestions

### 9. Edge Cases

**Test Edge Case 1: No Context Available**
- Request AI suggestions in Mapping before completing Clarity
- Verify graceful degradation (generic but still helpful suggestions)

**Test Edge Case 2: Empty Context**
- Complete Clarity with minimal information
- Request AI suggestions
- Verify suggestions are still generated (even if more generic)

**Test Edge Case 3: Multiple Requests**
- Request AI suggestions
- Confirm them
- Request MORE AI suggestions
- Verify coach can offer additional suggestions

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No crashes or errors
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing context
- ✅ Can request multiple rounds of suggestions

### 10. TypeScript Safety

**Verify at Runtime**:
- All suggestion objects match defined interfaces
- No `undefined` or `null` in unexpected places
- Proper array handling (empty arrays, not null)
- Type guards work correctly

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No runtime type errors
- ✅ All types match interfaces
- ✅ Null safety enforced

## Regression Testing

**Verify Existing Functionality Still Works**:
1. GROW framework still works (should be unaffected)
2. COMPASS phases without AI suggestions work normally
3. Clarity phase works without changes
4. Review phase works without changes
5. Safety checks still trigger (job security, emotional distress)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ GROW framework unaffected
- ✅ COMPASS phases without AI suggestions work as before

## Performance Testing

**Monitor**:
- API call latency (should not increase significantly)
- Token usage (suggestions may use more tokens)
- Response quality (suggestions should be helpful, not generic)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Latency increase < 500ms
- ✅ Token usage reasonable (< 200 extra tokens per suggestion)
- ✅ Suggestions are contextually relevant and helpful

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (All Complete ✅)
- [x] All 4 COMPASS phases have "THE FORK" pattern
- [x] AI suggestions are contextually relevant
- [x] Validation required after suggestions
- [x] User can choose self-generated or AI path
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Proper interfaces for all suggestion types

### Nice to Have (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] Suggestion quality metrics tracking
- [ ] A/B testing different prompts
- [ ] User preference learning (prefer AI vs. self-generated)
- [ ] Confidence scoring for suggestions

## Manual Testing Recommendations

To verify in production:
1. Start a COMPASS session
2. Progress through phases naturally
3. When reaching Mapping phase, provide 1 action, then request AI suggestions
4. Verify suggestions are contextually relevant
5. Verify validation question appears
6. Confirm suggestions before advancing

Repeat for Anchoring and Sustaining phases to ensure consistency.
