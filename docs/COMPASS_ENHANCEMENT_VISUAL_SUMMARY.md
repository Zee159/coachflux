## 📈 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Current COMPASS)

```
❌ No context extraction → Users repeat themselves
❌ High-level flow only → AI uncertain what to ask
❌ Limited conditionals → Robotic questioning
❌ No WAIT instructions → AI rushes ahead
❌ Inconsistent validation → Quality varies
❌ No completion checks → Incomplete stages
❌ Nudges present but triggers unclear
```

### AFTER (Enhanced COMPASS)

```
✅ Context extraction → No repetition
✅ Explicit question sequence → AI always knows next step
✅ Rich conditional logic → Adapts to user context
✅ WAIT instructions → Sequential flow enforced
✅ Validation loops → Quality guaranteed
✅ Completion checklists → All fields verified
✅ Nudges with clear triggers → Consistent application
```

---

## 🎨 Key Features Added

### 1. Context Extraction (All Stages)

```typescript
Before asking:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Check: Did user already mention this?  │
│   YES → Extract, move to next question │
│   NO  → Ask the question               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Result: Zero repetitive questions
```

### 2. Explicit Sequencing (All Stages)

```typescript
QUESTION 1 → [Condition met?] → YES → QUESTION 2
                              → NO  → Stay on Q1

Each question has:
├── Exact question text
├── What to extract
├── When to move forward
└── What NOT to do
```

### 3. Conditional Branching (All Stages)

```typescript
OWNERSHIP Example:

initial_confidence >= 7?
├── YES → SKIP fear exploration
│         Move to personal benefit
│
└── NO  → Continue to fear exploration
          └── Catastrophizing?
              ├── YES → Use reality check nudge
              └── NO  → Standard exploration
```

### 4. Validation Loops (Key Moments)

```typescript
OWNERSHIP - Personal Benefit:

User response:
├── Organizational benefit?
│   └── PUSH BACK: "What's in it for YOU?"
│       └── WAIT for personal benefit
│
└── Personal benefit?
    └── VALIDATE: "That's a strong motivator"
        └── Move forward
```

### 5. Completion Checklists (All Stages)

```typescript
Before advancing:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✅ Field 1 present?                     │
│ ✅ Field 2 present?                     │
│ ✅ Field 3 present?                     │
│                                         │
│ ALL YES? → Advance to next stage       │
│ ANY NO?  → Go back and complete        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 AI Nudges Integrated

### CLARITY (2 nudges)
- `specificity_push` - When change description vague
- `control_clarification` - When user sees no control

### OWNERSHIP (6 nudges)
- `catastrophe_reality_check` - Realistic worst-case
- `past_success_mining` - Find change experience
- `evidence_confrontation` - Challenge limiting beliefs
- `resistance_cost` - Energy of fighting change
- `threat_to_opportunity` - Reframe perspective
- `story_challenge` - Question negative narrative

### MAPPING (4 nudges)
- `reduce_scope` - Make action smaller
- `concretize_action` - Get specific day/time
- `build_in_backup` - Create support plan
- `perfect_to_progress` - Learning vs perfection

### PRACTICE (4 nudges)
- `lower_the_bar` - One step at a time
- `future_self_anchor` - How will you feel?
- `reflect_breakthrough` - Recognize insight
- `confidence_progress_highlight` - Celebrate shift

**Total**: 16 AI nudges with clear triggers

## 💡 Real Example: Side-by-Side

### OLD COMPASS (Repetitive)

```
AI: "How confident are you?"
User: "3/10. I'm not tech-savvy."

AI: "What's making you unconfident?"
User: "I just said - not tech-savvy."

AI: "What benefits do you see?"
User: "I don't know."

AI: "Maybe you'll learn skills?"
User: "Maybe."

→ No transformation
→ Repetitive
→ Ends at 3/10
```

### NEW COMPASS (Context-Aware)

```
AI: "On 1-10, how confident?"
User: "3/10. I'm not tech-savvy."
[Extracts: confidence=3, limiting_belief="not tech-savvy"]

AI: "Worst that could REALISTICALLY happen?"
[Uses catastrophe_reality_check immediately]
User: "I'd be slower, need help."

AI: "What could YOU gain personally?"
User: "I don't know."

AI: "Could this: build career skills? Make you valuable?"
[Offers AI suggestions, WAITS for validation]
User: "The valuable expert thing. I did that with Slack."

AI: "You're a Slack expert but call yourself 'not tech-savvy'. What if that's not accurate?"
[Uses evidence_confrontation with their evidence]
User: "Huh. I CAN learn tech. Just need time."

AI: "Where's confidence now?"
User: "6/10. Not scared anymore."
[+3 increase → SUCCESS]

→ Clear transformation
→ Zero repetition
→ Ends at 6/10
```
