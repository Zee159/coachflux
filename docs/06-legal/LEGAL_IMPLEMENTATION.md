  termsAccepted: v.boolean(),
  privacyAccepted: v.boolean(),
  acceptedAt: v.number(),
  termsVersion: v.string(),

### 3. Backend Mutations & Queries

**File:** `convex/mutations.ts`

  args: {
    userId: v.id("users"),
    termsVersion: v.string(),
    privacyVersion: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(args.userId, {
      legalConsent: {
        termsAccepted: true,
        privacyAccepted: true,
        acceptedAt: Date.now(),
        termsVersion: args.termsVersion,
        privacyVersion: args.privacyVersion,
      },
    });
  },
});
```

**File:** `convex/queries.ts`

Added `checkLegalConsent` query:
```typescript
export const checkLegalConsent = query({
  args: { userId: v.id("users") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const user = await ctx.db.get(args.userId);
    if (user === null || user === undefined) {
      return null;
    }
    return user.legalConsent ?? null;
  },
});
```
