# üõ°Ô∏è Psychological Safety Framework: Team Development

**Based on:** Google's Project Aristotle research (1,400 teams, 4 years)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes | **Steps:** 5 | **Best for:** Team effectiveness, building trust, culture

**Key Finding:** Psychological safety accounts for 43% of team performance variance‚Äîmore important than talent or experience.

## Core Research Finding

Google studied why some teams succeed and others fail. Top 5 factors:

1. **Psychological Safety** (43% variance) ‚Üê Most important
2. Dependability (lower variance)
3. Structure & Clarity (lower variance)
4. Meaning (lower variance)
5. Impact (lower variance)

**Critical Insight:** If psychological safety is low, the other 4 factors don't matter. People won't contribute.

## Step 1: ASSESS PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY (4 min)

**Rate 1‚Äì10: How safe do team members feel speaking up?**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "Can team members ask seemingly 'dumb' questions without fear?"
2. "If someone makes a mistake, does the team blame or learn?"
3. "Can people disagree with you without risking their standing?"
4. "Are people willing to admit they don't know something?"
5. "Do people share half-formed ideas or only fully-baked ones?"
6. "What happens when someone makes a mistake?"
7. "On a scale of 1‚Äì10, how psychologically safe is your team?"

**Safety Rating:**
- 1‚Äì3: Very low (people hold back, defensive)
- 4‚Äì5: Low-moderate (caution, some holding back)
- 6‚Äì7: Moderate-high (most people share ideas)
- 8‚Äì9: High (fully open, mistakes treated as learning)
- 10: Exceptional (fully vulnerable)

**Most healthy teams:** 6‚Äì8 range

## Step 2: IDENTIFY BARRIERS (4 min)

**What's blocking psychological safety?**

**Five Common Barriers:**

| Barrier | What It Looks Like | Fix |
|---------|------|---|
| **Leader defensiveness** | Leader gets defensive when questioned | Leader models vulnerability |
| **Blame culture** | Mistakes = failure + punishment | Blameless retrospectives, celebrate learning |
| **Past incidents** | Someone was humiliated/fired for speaking up | Acknowledge, apologise, signal change |
| **Role confusion** | Unclear who decides what or what's safe | Clarify roles, define safe-to-fail zones |
| **Interpersonal conflict** | Team members don't trust each other | Address conflicts directly, rebuild relationships |

**Coach Questions:**
1. "What's the main reason people hold back?"
2. "Is this about the leader, team culture, past incidents, or role confusion?"
3. "Give me an example: When did someone NOT speak up? What were they afraid of?"
4. "What would a psychologically safe culture look like here?"
5. "What's one behaviour YOU could change?"

**Find Root Cause, Not Symptom:**
- Symptom: "People don't share ideas"
- Root cause: "Leader gets defensive when challenged" ‚Üê Fix this
- vs.
- Root cause: "Past person was blamed publicly" ‚Üê Fix this differently

## Step 3: DESIGN INTERVENTIONS (5 min)

**What specific actions will rebuild safety?**

**By Barrier Type:**

### If Barrier = Leader Defensiveness
- Leader shares mistakes first ("Here's something I got wrong...")
- Leader asks "Why?" with genuine curiosity, not challenge
- Leader celebrates ideas that disagree with leader's thinking
- Leader admits when they don't know

**Action:** "At next team meeting, I'll share one mistake I made and what I learned"

### If Barrier = Blame Culture
- Start blameless retrospectives ("What can we learn?")
- Celebrate "intelligent failures" (tried something, learned)
- Give explicit permission to experiment
- Establish "safe-to-fail zones" where mistakes are expected

**Action:** "Weekly 'Learning Moments' where team shares what didn't work and why"

### If Barrier = Past Incidents
- Leader acknowledges what happened
- Leader explains how they've changed
- Show new behaviour (that's the proof, not just words)
- Give it time (trust rebuilds slowly)

**Action:** "I want to address what happened last year. I handled it wrong. Here's how I've changed..."

### If Barrier = Role Confusion
- Clarify decision rights ("Who decides what?")
- Define safe-to-fail zones ("Where can you experiment?")
- Be explicit about consequences
- Empower people within clear boundaries

**Action:** "On hiring, I decide. On tools, the team decides. On process, we decide together."

### If Barrier = Interpersonal Conflict
- Address conflicts directly (not via proxy)
- Help people understand each other
- Rebuild relationships (sometimes need mediation)
- Create collaboration rituals

**Action:** "I'm noticing tension between X and Y. Let's talk about it."

---

## Step 4: BUILD RITUALS & NORMS (4 min)

**What repeatable practices will reinforce safety?**

**Psychological safety requires REPEATED, INTENTIONAL practices:**

### Vulnerability Rituals (Normalise Imperfection)
- Weekly team check-in: "How are you really doing?" (personal, not just work)
- Failure sharing: "One thing I tried this week that didn't work"
- Mistake confession: "A mistake I made and how I handled it"

### Disagreement Rituals (Normalise Different Views)
- "What am I missing?" question (weekly)
- Devil's advocate discussions
- Pre-decision debate: "What are the risks?"

### Learning Rituals (Normalise Growth)
- Retrospectives focused on learning (NOT blame)
- "Learning moments" celebrating learning from failure
- Peer teaching (someone shares what they learned)

### Recognition Rituals (Reinforce Values)
- Celebrate people who admit mistakes early
- Celebrate good questions
- Celebrate challenges to the status quo

**Key:** Rituals must be REPEATED and OWNED BY GROUP (not just leader doing them)

**Start with 1‚Äì2 rituals, make them stick before adding more.**

---

## Step 5: REVIEW & COMMITMENT (2 min)

**Consolidate and commit.**

**Coach Questions:**
1. "Current safety score?"
2. "Target safety score?"
3. "Main interventions?"
4. "Key rituals you'll start?"
5. "How long until you see real change?" (Usually 4‚Äì8 weeks)
6. "How will you reassess?"

**Timeline Expectations:**
- Week 1‚Äì2: People cautiously test if it's safe
- Week 3‚Äì4: A few people start speaking up
- Week 5‚Äì8: Culture noticeably shifting
- Week 8+: New norms becoming "how we work"

## Real Session Example

```
ASSESS:
Coach: "Can team members ask dumb questions without fear?"
Lead: "Not really. People figure things out first."
Coach: "On a scale 1‚Äì10?"
Lead: "Maybe 4. People are careful."

IDENTIFY BARRIERS:
Coach: "What makes them careful?"
Lead: "Probably me. When someone suggests something, I get defensive."
Coach: "So leader defensiveness. What else?"
Lead: "We had a failure last year. Someone spoke up too late. They got blamed. People remember that."
Coach: "So past incident creating fear. What else?"
Lead: "Time pressure. No time for mistakes."
Coach: "Three barriers: your defensiveness, past incident, time pressure. Which is most urgent?"
Lead: "My defensiveness. If I change, people might feel safer."

INTERVENTIONS:
Coach: "How do you address your defensiveness?"
Lead: "Become curious when challenged? Ask 'Tell me more, I want to understand' instead of defending."
Coach: "For the past incident?"
Lead: "Acknowledge it at next team meeting. Explain I handled it wrong. Show I've changed."
Coach: "For time pressure?"
Lead: "Create 'safe-to-fail zones' where experimentation is expected, mistakes are learning."

RITUALS:
Coach: "What practices will make this stick?"
Lead: "Maybe a weekly check-in where I ask 'What could I be doing better?'"
Lead: "And monthly 'Learning Moments' where team shares what didn't work."
Coach: "Perfect. Repeated practices rebuild culture."

REVIEW:
Coach: "Current safety: 4. Target? 7‚Äì8. Timeline? 6 weeks. How reassess? Observe behaviours and re-do the survey."
Lead: "Got it. I'll model vulnerability, acknowledge the past, create safe zones, start rituals."
```

## Guardrails

‚ùå **Don't expect immediate change**  
Safety takes 4‚Äì8 weeks to rebuild.

‚ùå **Don't do one-time initiatives**  
"One off-site won't fix safety." Rituals must be repeated.

‚ùå **Don't rely on words without behaviour**  
Leader must change behaviour FIRST. That's the proof.

‚ùå **Don't skip the leader's role**  
Leader behaviour is #1 factor. Nothing changes without leader change.

‚ùå **Don't address symptoms**  
Teach better communication skills when real barrier is blame culture? Won't work.

---

## Leader's Critical Role

**Leader is the single biggest factor in psychological safety.**

**What leader must do:**
1. Go vulnerable first (admit mistakes)
2. Respond to disagreement with curiosity (not defensiveness)
3. Celebrate learning from failure
4. Model the norms you want
5. Protect people who take interpersonal risks

**Without leader behaviour change, nothing shifts.**
